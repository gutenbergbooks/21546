THE CIRCUS LION</h1>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>NERO HAS SOME FUN</h3>

<p>Far off in the jungle of Africa lived a
family of lions.</p>

<p>Africa, you know, is a very hot country,
and what we, in this land, would call a
forest, or woods, is called a "jungle" there. In
the jungle grew many trees, and the ground was
covered with low vines and bushes so that animals,
creeping along, could scarcely be seen.
That was why the animals liked the jungle so
much; they could roam about in it, play and get
their meals, and the black hunters and the white
huntsmen who sometimes came to the jungle,
could not easily see to shoot the lions, elephants
and other beasts.</p>

<p>There were five lions in this jungle family,
and I am going to tell you the story of one of
them, named Nero. Nero was a little boy lion,
about two years old, but please don't think he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
was a baby because he was only two years old.
Lions grow much faster than boys and girls,
and a lion of two years is quite large and strong,
with sharp claws and sharper teeth.</p>

<p>Nero lived with his father and mother, Mr.
and Mrs. Lion, and his brother Chet and his
sister Boo, in a cave in the African jungle. The
cave was among the rocks, and not far from a
spring of water where the lions went to drink
each night. They drank only at night because
that was the safest time; the hunters could not
so easily see the shaggy lions with their big
heads, and manes larger than those of a horse.</p>

<p>Nero was the largest of the three lion children,
and he was called Nero because that always
seems to be the right name for some one large
and strong. Chet, who was Nero's brother, got
his name because, when he was a little baby
lion cub, he used to make that sound when he
cried for his dinner.</p>

<p>As for Boo&mdash;well, I must tell you in what a
funny way she got her name, and then I'll go
on with the story of Nero. When Boo, who
was Nero's sister, was a little baby lion, she was
sitting in the front of the jungle cave one day,
waiting for her mother to come back. Mrs.
Lion had gone out a little way into the jungle
to get something to eat.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Boo, who up to then had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
name, heard some one coming along the jungle
path, stepping on twigs and tree branches and
making them crack. By this sound the little
girl lion cub knew some one was coming.</p>

<p>"That must be my mother," thought Boo.
"I'll just hide behind this piece of rock, and
then I'll jump out and make believe to scare her.
It will be lots of fun."</p>

<p>So Boo hid behind the rock near the front
door of the cave-house, and, when the noise came
nearer, the little girl lion jumped out and cried:
"Boo!" or something that sounded very much
like it.</p>

<p>But the little girl lion had made a mistake.
Instead of her mother who was coming along
the jungle path, it was a big prickly hedgehog
with sharp quills all over his back, and when
Boo put out her paw she was stuck full of stickery
quills. The quills in a hedgehog's back are
loose, and come out easily.</p>

<p>"Boo! Boo!" roared the little lion cub girl,
but this time she was crying instead of trying
to make believe scare some one. The hedgehog,
however, was very much frightened&mdash;almost all
the jungle animals were afraid of the lions&mdash;and
this hedgehog ran away.</p>

<p>But the little girl lion's paw hurt her very
much, and when a little later, Mrs. Lion came
back, with something to eat, and found out what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
had happened, she said Boo had been very foolish.</p>

<p>And when Mr. Lion heard the story, and Nero
and Chet had been told about it, they all said
that "Boo" would be a very good name for the
little sister lion.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you call me," said Boo,
speaking in lion talk of course. "I don't care
what my name is, if you'll only get these hedgehog
stickers out of my paw."</p>

<p>Then they pulled the hedgehog spines out of
the little girl lion's paw, and she washed it in
cool water at the spring, which made her foot
feel better.</p>

<p>For two years the lion cubs, Nero, Chet and
Boo, had lived with their father and mother in
the jungle cave. They learned how to tread
softly on the leaves and twigs of the jungle path,
so as to make no noise. They learned how to
creep quietly down to the spring at night to get
a drink, so that the hunters would not hear them.</p>

<p>All about them, in the jungle, lived other wild
animals. There were several families of lions
in that same part of the forest, and very often
a herd of elephants would pass by, tramping
and crashing their way through the jungle. The
lions never bothered the elephants.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Nero?" asked his
mother of the lion boy cub one day, as she saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
him starting out from the jungle cave. "Where
are you going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just out to have some fun," he answered.
"I'm going to play with Switchie."</p>

<p>"Switchie," was the name of another lion boy
cub, who lived in the cave next to Nero's. He
was about a year older than the lion chap about
whom I am going to tell you in this story.
Switchie was called that because he switched
his tail about in such a funny way.</p>

<p>"So you are going to play with Switchie, are
you?" asked Mrs. Lion, as she looked at a place
where a sharp stone had cut her foot, though
the sore was now getting better. "Well, if you
go to play with that lion boy don't get into
mischief."</p>

<p>"What's mischief, Ma?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"Mischief is trouble," his mother answered,
speaking in lion talk, just as your dog or your
cat speaks its own kind of language. "So don't
get into trouble. Don't go to the spring now
to get a drink, for the hunters may be watching,
and may shoot you with an arrow, or with a
queer lead stone, from a thing called a gun,
which is worse. So don't get into mischief."</p>

<p>"I won't," promised Nero, and he meant to
keep his word, but then he didn't count on
Switchie. That chap was a bold little lion cub,
larger than Nero, and always up to some trick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>"Hello, Nero!" growled Switchie, when he
saw his friend coming along the jungle path.</p>

<p>"Hello!" growled Nero.</p>

<p>Now please don't imagine, just because these
lions growled, that they were cross. They
weren't anything of the sort. That was just their
way of talking. Your dog barks and growls,
and that is his way of speaking. Your cat mews
and sometimes growls or "spits," and often purrs,
especially when you tickle her ears. And a lion
always growls when he talks. When he is angry
he roars&mdash;that's the difference. And, I almost
forgot, lions can purr, too, only it sounds like
a buzz saw instead of the way your cat purrs.
But then a lion's throat is very big, and so his
purr has to be big also.</p>

<p>"Want to have some fun?" asked Switchie,
as Nero lay down in the jungle shade.</p>

<p>"That's what I came over for," Nero answered.
"Only my mother said I wasn't to get
into any mischief."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we won't do anything like that!"
replied Switchie. "We'll just go along in the
jungle and have some fun. I know where there
is some soft grass, and we can roll over and over
in that and scratch our backs."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Nero. "We'll go there."</p>

<p>So Switchie led the way along another jungle
path to a place where very few trees grew. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
the midst of these few trees was a grassy place.
That is, it had been green and grassy once when
it was raining, which it does for several months
at a time in the jungle. But the rains had
stopped, the hot sun had come out from behind
the clouds and dried the grass up, so that it was
now like hay.</p>

<p>"And it's just fine to roll in. It scratches
your back just hard enough," said Switchie, making
his tail, with the tuft of hair on the end,
swing about in a funny way.</p>

<p>"I like to have my back scratched," said Nero.</p>

<p>So the two boy lions went to have some fun
and roll in the dried grass. It was just as if
you had gone to roll and tumble on the hay in
Grandpa's barn. The lion boys leaped about,
jumped over one another, made believe bite one
another and played tag with their paws.</p>

<p>As Switchie had said, the dried, curled grass
tickled their backs just enough when they rolled
over and over in it. But at last Switchie said:</p>

<p>"Say, aren't you thirsty?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Nero, "I am."</p>

<p>"Then let's go to the spring and get a drink,"
went on Switchie.</p>

<p>"Oh no! My mother said I wasn't to go to
the spring in the daytime!" exclaimed Nero.
"There may be hunters there, waiting to shoot
us."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>"Oh, I don't believe there are," said Switchie.
"I'll tell you what we can do. My mother didn't
tell me not to go to the spring, so I'll walk on
ahead until we come to it. Then I can look
and see if there are any hunters. If there aren't
you can come out of the jungle and get a drink.
Won't that be all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess it will," said Nero. "Mother
wouldn't want me not to have a drink. All she's
afraid of are the hunters."</p>

<p>"Then come on!" growled Switchie. "We'll
go to the spring, and we'll have some fun on the
way."</p>

<p>So the two boy lions walked along the jungle
path to the spring where all the animals drank.
On the way they fell down and rolled over and
cuffed one another with their paws&mdash;the way
all lions do to have fun. Nero was having a
very good time, and he never gave a thought
about not minding his mother.</p>

<p>At last Switchie and Nero came close to the
spring.</p>

<p>"Now you stay behind this bush until I look
out and see if there are any hunters," said
Switchie.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Nero.</p>

<p>Carefully the older lion boy peeped through
the bushes. There was no one at the spring
except some little monkeys, getting a drink, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
as soon as they saw the lion boy away they scampered,
chattering, for the monkeys were afraid
of the lions.</p>

<p>"Everything is all right!" called Switchie to
the hiding Nero. "There are no hunters!
Come on and get a drink."</p>

<p>Nero was very thirsty, after having played
and had fun in the hot jungle sun, and he very
much wanted a drink. So he rushed down to
the spring, which was quite a large one, and
began to lap up the water, just as your dog or
cat drinks milk from a dish.</p>

<p>"Isn't this fun?" growled Switchie, as he
stopped drinking for a moment. "Aren't we
having fun, Nero?"</p>

<p>"Lots of fun!" answered the other lion cub.</p>

<p>And just then something happened. There
was a rattle of the dried leaves in the jungle
back of the spring. Something very hard hit
Nero in the side, and a voice cried:</p>

<p>"There! I'll teach you to drink from my edge
of the spring! Take that!"</p>

<p>And the next moment Nero felt himself sliding
down the slippery bank of the spring, and
into the water he went with a big splash!</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>NERO GOES HUNTING</h3>

<p>The first thought of Nero, the little lion
cub boy, as he felt himself falling into
the spring of water, was that Switchie
had played a joke and pushed him in.</p>

<p>"And when I get out I'll push <i>him</i> in,"
thought Nero. But that was all he had time to
think, just then, for his head went away under
the water&mdash;as the spring was deep&mdash;and Nero
had to think of getting out. So he splashed and
scrambled his way to shore, clawing and spluttering
and half choking, for lions are not good
swimmers. Indeed few animals of the cat
family are, and lions belong to the cat family,
you know, as do tigers and jaguars.</p>

<p>So, with his eyes and nose and mouth full of
water, Nero scrambled to shore, a very wet and
bedraggled lion boy indeed. On the shore he
saw Switchie standing looking at him. Switchie
was nice and dry.</p>

<p>"What did you do that for?" growled Nero
to Switchie, as soon as our friend had shaken
some of the water off his shaggy, tawny-yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
coat. "I'll fix you for that! Fun is all right,
but you know I don't like jumping into the
water, however much I like a drink from the
spring. Now I'm going to push you in!" and
Nero started to run toward Switchie.</p>

<p>"Hey! Wait a minute!" cried Switchie, raising
his paw to push Nero away if the younger
lion cub should come too near. "I didn't do
anything to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did!" growled Nero. "You pushed
me into the water!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" answered Switchie. "I was
taking my second drink, when I heard a noise,
and I looked up and saw you sliding down into
the water. But I didn't push you in."</p>

<p>"Who did, then?" asked Nero, looking
around, quite fiercely for a little lion boy.
"Who did? If I find out, I'll push him in! If
it was one of the monkeys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't any of them," said Switchie
quickly. "They won't come near the spring
when we lions are drinking."</p>

<p>"But it was some one!" said Nero. "I heard
some one say I couldn't drink on his edge of the
spring, and then I was pushed in. Who did
it? I want to know that!"</p>

<p>"I did it!" said a grumbling sort of voice,
and up out of the spring came something which,
at first, looked like <a name="thought" id="thought"></a>a log of wood. It was dark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
and had knobs, or warts, on it, as has the trunk
of a tree.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" asked Nero, in surprise.
"Are you a log of wood that can speak?"</p>

<p>"Look out! Gracious no! That's a crocodile!"
cried Switchie. "I forgot about their being
here. Come on! Run!"</p>

<p>And as Nero saw what he had thought was a
log of wood open a big mouth with many sharp
teeth in it, the little lion boy ran after Switchie,
who scampered off along the jungle path as fast
as he could go.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What was that thing
which looked like a log floating in the water?"
asked Nero, when he and Switchie stopped to
rest in the shadow of a big tree.</p>

<p>"That's a crocodile, I told you!" said Switchie.
"They are very big and strong, and if they get
hold of your soft and tender nose, when you are
drinking at the pool, they can pull you under
water and drown you. You want to be careful
about crocodiles."</p>

<p>"Well, I will," said Nero. "Only I didn't
know about them before. Was it the crocodile
who knocked me into the water?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Switchie, "it was. A crocodile
has a long and very strong tail, with knobs
and sharp ridges on it. They can knock you
into the water with their tail, and then they bite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
you. I didn't know there were crocodiles at
our spring, or I wouldn't have gone there in
the daytime for a drink. At night it's all right,
for then they can't see you so plainly."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>"Well, this one saw me all right," said Nero.
"My side is sore where he knocked me into the
spring."</p>

<p>"It's lucky your nose isn't sore where he might
have bitten you," growled Switchie. "That was
a mean crocodile! We had just as good right
to drink on that side of the spring-pool as he
had!"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe we had," said Nero. "But he
was stronger than I, and so he knocked me in.
Now I'm all wet!"</p>

<p>And so Nero learned one of the first lessons of
the jungle, that it is the strongest and fiercest
animals that have the best of it.</p>

<p>The elephants of the jungle, which are the
largest animals, crash their way through, afraid
of nothing except the men hunters. And the
lions, when the elephants are not near, are the
real kings of the jungle. Few animals stay to
drink at the spring when the lion roars, to say
he is coming.</p>

<p>But this was in daylight and Switchie and
Nero were only lion cubs, so, I suppose, the
crocodile was not afraid of them. And, being
big and strong, he just knocked Nero into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
water, and claimed that as his side of the pool,
though he had no right to.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Switchie to Nero, after they
had gone a little way further through the jungle
and back from the spring. "Come on; I know
how we can have some more fun."</p>

<p>"No, I've had enough for to-day," said Nero.
"I'm going home and lie down in the cave. My
side hurts where the crocodile struck me with
his tail."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on! Play tag!" begged Switchie.</p>

<p>"No," said Nero. "I'm going home."</p>

<p>And home he went. As soon as his mother
saw him, wet and muddy as he still was, Mrs.
Lion said:</p>

<p>"Well, Nero, what happened to you? Did
you get into mischief?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Ma," answered Nero. "But
I got in the spring!"</p>

<p>"There! I told you to keep away from the
water hole in the daytime!" said Mrs. Lion. "I
knew something would happen if you played
with that Switchie. That lion cub will get into
trouble some day. He is too bold!"</p>

<p>"A crocodile knocked me into the water,"
explained Nero. "It wasn't Switchie's fault."</p>

<p>"It was the fault of both you lion boys for
going where you ought not to," said Nero's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
mother. "Now you see what happened. But
I'm sorry your side is hurt. Go into the cave
and lie down. I'll bring you a nice piece of
goat meat to eat, and get some soft grass to make
you a bed. You'll be all right in a few days,
but after this&mdash;mind me!"</p>

<p>"I will," promised Nero.</p>

<p>The soft grass, which his mother pawed into
a bed for him with her sharp claws, felt very
comfortable to his sore side. And the goat's
meat, which lions eat when they can get it, tasted
very good. Nero soon became dry and then
he went to sleep.</p>

<p>When he awakened his brother Chet and his
sister Boo were in the cave looking at him.</p>

<p>"Mother says you got into mischief!" exclaimed
Boo. "Tell us all about it, Nero."</p>

<p>So Nero did, and when his story was ended
Chet said enviously:</p>

<p>"I wish I had been there. If I had, I'd have
scratched that crocodile with my claws!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't have hurt him that way," said
Mr. Lion, who came into the cave just then.
"Crocodiles have a very hard, thick skin on
their backs and tails, much harder and thicker
than our skin, and even that of an elephant.
You can't hurt a crocodile by scratching his back.
The only way to hurt them is to turn them over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
and while you are trying to do that they'll knock
you about with the big tail. So keep away from
the crocodiles, children."</p>

<p>"I will," said Nero, and Boo and Chet said
the same thing.</p>

<p>"Now hurry and get well," said Nero's father
to him, as the lion boy lay in the cave. "You
are growing large and strong, and soon you will
have to learn to go hunting."</p>

<p>"What's hunting?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"It is learning how to get your own things to
eat," said his father. "When you were little,
your mother and I hunted the goats and other
animals that we have to eat. But now you are
getting big enough to go hunting for yourself.
Only I must give you a few lessons."</p>

<p>"Can't I learn to hunt, too?" asked Chet.</p>

<p>"And I?" Boo wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Yes," said their father. "After I teach Nero
I'll teach you. One at a time. The jungle is
full of danger, and I can teach only one of you
at a time how to be careful. So get good and
well and strong, Nero, and soon I'll take you
on a hunt."</p>

<p>Nero thought he would like this, so he stayed
quietly in the cave for a day or two, until his
side, where the crocodile had struck him with
the sharp-ridged tail, felt much better.</p>

<p>One day, about a week after Nero had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
tossed into the spring, he noticed his father
sharpening his claws on the bark of a tree.</p>

<p>"What's he doing that for?" Nero asked his
mother.</p>

<p>"To get ready for the jungle hunt to-night,"
answered Mrs. Lion. "I heard him say something
about taking you, so perhaps you had
better sharpen your claws, also."</p>

<p>"I will," answered Nero, and he did, making
the bits of bark fly as he pulled it from a tree
in the jungle, not far from the cave where he
lived.</p>

<p>When it began to get dark, which it does very
early in the big African forest, as the thick
trees shut out the light of the sun, Nero said to
his mother:</p>

<p>"Aren't we going to have any supper?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night&mdash;that is, not right away," said
Mr. Lion. "You are going to hunt for your
supper, Nero."</p>

<p>"But I am very hungry," returned the little
lion boy, who was growing bigger and stronger
every day.</p>

<p>"Then you will hunt all the better," growled
his father. "There is nothing like being hungry
to make a good hunter-lion. Come, now is the
time I have long waited for&mdash;to teach you to
hunt in the jungle. Your mother and Chet and
Boo are going to have supper with Switchie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
and his folks. You and I are going to hunt for
ourselves. Come, we will go into a part of the
jungle where you have never yet been."</p>

<p>And Nero felt very much excited when
he heard his father say this. The lion cub felt
brave and strong, and he knew that his teeth
and claws were very sharp.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the jungle, which was now
quite dark, there came a distant sound as if of
thunder. There was a rumble and a roar, and
the very ground seemed to shake.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Nero, looking at his
father.</p>
<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>NERO IS SHOT</h3>

<p>Once again, as Nero stood with Mr. Lion
at the front door of the jungle cave, the
roaring sound echoed among the trees.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the boy lion once more.</p>

<p>"That is the roaring of other lions, who are
also going out to hunt to-night," said Nero's
father. "There will be many of us lions in the
jungle; perhaps others, like you, who are going
out for the first time. You must be brave and
strong. Remember the lessons your mother and
I have taught you. Crouch down and jump
hard. Strike hard with your paws and dig deep
with your sharp claws. That is what they are
for&mdash;to help you hunt so that you may get things
to eat. Now we will start."</p>

<p>By this time the jungle around the cave where
Nero lived seemed filled with the roarings of
other lions. The very ground seemed to tremble.
Nero was excited, but he was sure he could
hunt well. He was a brave lion, and he knew
he was strong and nearly full grown now, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
he knew his teeth were sharp, as were his claws,
and his paws were strong, both for striking and
leaping, for that is how a lion hunts.</p>

<p>"Boom! Boom!" rolled out the lions' roars
in the jungle.</p>

<p>"Ah, we shall have a grand hunt to-night!"
said Nero's father. "I hope you are still
hungry."</p>

<p>"Yes I am, very," answered the boy lion.</p>

<p>"That is good," returned the father. "Now
we will start. At first stay close to me, but when
you see a goat or a sheep or some other animal
you think you would like to eat, spring on it
and strike it with your claws."</p>

<p>Of course this sounds cruel, but lions must
get their food this way; there is no other.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nero opened his mouth and gave
a great roar, the loudest he had ever uttered.
It shook the ground on which he stood. The
trembling of the earth seemed to tickle the
pads of skin and flesh of his paws, pads which
were the same to him as your shoes are to
you.</p>

<p>"Ha, that was a fine roar, Nero!" said his
father. "Roar again!"</p>

<p>And Nero did, louder than at first.</p>

<p>"That's the way!" cried Mr. Lion. "That
will tell the other jungle folk to keep out of our
way when we are having a night-hunt."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>And that, I suppose, is why lions roar. They
do it to frighten away the other animals who
might spoil their hunt in the jungle.</p>

<p>For the lion's voice, when he roars, is frightfully
loud. There is no other animal who can
make so much noise&mdash;not even the elephant,
which is larger than ten lions. If you have
ever heard a lion roar, even in his circus cage,
or in a city park, you will never forget it.</p>

<p>And so Nero roared, and his father roared,
and the other lions, all about them in the jungle,
roared until there was a regular lion chorus,
and the other beasts, hearing it, slunk back to
their dens or caves, or crouched under fallen
trees, and one after another said to himself:</p>

<p>"The lions are out hunting to-night. It is
best for us to stay in until they have finished.
Then it will be our turn."</p>

<p>And so you see how it is that the strength of
a lion makes the other animals afraid when the
big animals hunt. Elephants do not need to fear
lions, for the big animals, with trunks and tusks,
do not eat the same kind of food lions eat. Elephants
live on grass, hay, palm-nuts and things
that grow. But the lion eats only meat, and he
would eat an elephant if he could get one, though
it might take him a long while.</p>

<p>"Now for the hunt!" said Mr. Lion, as he
led Nero into the jungle. "Tread softly. Sniff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
with your nose until you smell something worth
hunting, and then spring on it."</p>

<p>Though lions, like cats, can see pretty well
in the dark, they have to depend a great deal in
their hunting on what they can smell with their
nose, just as your dog can smell a bone, and tell,
in that way, where he has buried it in the garden.</p>

<p>So Nero and his father joined the other lions
on their march through the jungle in search
of something to eat. And Nero kept getting
hungrier and hungrier, so that he looked eagerly
around every side of him in the darkness, and
sniffed so that he might know when he came near
anything he could kill and eat.</p>

<p>The other lions were doing the same thing.
They did not roar now, but went quietly, slinking
through the jungle as quietly as your cat
creeps through the grass when she is trying to
catch a sparrow. The lions had done enough
roaring to scare away other animals who might
bother them in their hunt. Now they did not
roar any longer, for they did not want to scare
away the smaller beasts which were food for
them in their hunger.</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave you for a while now,
Nero," said Mr. Lion, after a bit. "You will
have to get along by yourself. But don't forget
the lessons your mother and I taught you."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Nero.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>"I am going to the front, to march along with
the older men lions," said Nero's father. "We
are going to lead you young lions where there
will be good hunting."</p>

<p>"I shall like that," growled Nero, and he
sprang on a tree trunk as he passed, and dug
deep into the soft bark.</p>

<p>"Hi! Quit that! You're scattering bark in
my eyes!" said a voice behind Nero. It was not
a loud voice, for one has to be quiet when hunting
in the jungle.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked Nero, thinking for a
moment it might be the crocodile who had tossed
him into the jungle pool.</p>

<p>"It is I&mdash;Switchie," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you hunting, too?" asked Nero, glad
to find that he knew some one among the lions
besides his father. "Have you killed anything
yet?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet. But I shall pretty soon," answered
Switchie. "This isn't my first hunt.
I've been out at night before."</p>

<p>"Isn't it great!" said Nero. "I hope I can
kill a big buffalo. That would make a fine
meal!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should say it would!" exclaimed
Switchie. "But you had better leave the buffaloes
to your father and the other big men lions.
They always take them. It takes a big lion to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
catch a buffalo, and even then sometimes the buffaloes
kill a lion."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"With their sharp horns," answered Switchie.
"Buffaloes have terribly sharp horns. Better
look out for them. Better stick to the goats and
the sheep, or even a rabbit, until you learn more
about hunting. As for me, I am old enough
now to try for a buffalo, I think. So if you see
one, tell me, and I'll kill it and give you some."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'm nearly as big and strong
as you," growled Nero. "If I see a buffalo I'll
jump on his back, and strike him with my paw."</p>

<p>"All right. But if you get hurt don't say I
didn't tell you to be careful," warned Switchie.
"Now come on! We must hurry or we shall
be left behind. Ho for the jungle hunt!"</p>

<p>The two boy lions hurried on after the others.
Ahead of them they could hear, faintly, the tread
of the older beasts as they walked along, looking
for something to strike and kill, to stop the
terrible hunger. The lions only went on a hunt
when they wanted something to eat. They did
not kill for fun. It was their way of getting a
living.</p>

<p>Suddenly, up in front, there sounded a crash
among the tangled vines, bushes and trees of the
jungle. Then came a roar, but not a very loud
one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>"What's that?" asked Nero of Switchie.</p>

<p>"Oh, that isn't any thing. Don't be afraid,"
answered the other lion.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid!" said Nero. "Only, I want
to learn things. I never hunted in the jungle at
night before, and I don't know so much about it
as you do. What was that noise?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Switchie, easily, "that, I suppose,
was my father, or yours, killing some big animal.
Maybe it was a buffalo. We'll soon find out."</p>

<p>And the two boy lions did. As they came to
an open place in the jungle they saw Nero's
father and that of Switchie crouching near something
big and black lying on the ground. Off to
one side was a lion, licking, with his big red
tongue, a sore place on his leg.</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Nero quickly, of his
father.</p>

<p>"We killed a buffalo, Cruncher and I," said
Mr. Lion, as he nodded toward Switchie's father,
whose name was Cruncher. "We killed a buffalo,
but my cousin, Chaw, is hurt. The buffalo
stuck him with one of his horns. Then I
struck down the buffalo. Here, Nero, is a bit
of meat for you, and, Switchie, you may have
some. But not much. This meat belongs to
Cruncher and me. We will give you a little,
but, if you want any more, you must hunt for
yourselves. I fed you when you were a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
baby lion, Nero, but now that you are big you
must learn to feed and hunt for yourself."</p>

<p>And this, too, is the law of the jungle.</p>

<p>Switchie and Nero eagerly ate the bits of
meat the older lions gave them, and then the hunt
went on. Nero was still very hungry, and so
was Switchie, and pretty soon Nero saw a small
animal creeping along through the jungle.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are trying to get away from me!"
thought Nero, who had gone to one side, and
away from the others. "But I'll get you!"</p>

<p>Then he stalked, or crept softly after, the animal,
which was a big rabbit, and, all of a sudden,
Nero leaped and caught the smaller beast.</p>

<p>"At last I have hunted for myself!" thought
Nero, as he ate his meal. "This is great! But
it is not enough. I must have more!"</p>

<p>He went farther on in the jungle, and, all at
once, he heard a goat bleating.</p>

<p>"Baa-a-a-a! Baa!" bleated the goat.</p>

<p>"Ha! There is something else I can catch
for my supper!" thought Nero. "I am getting
to be quite a hunter!"</p>

<p>By this time he was far off from his father and
the other lions. But he did not mind that. He
felt sure he could find his way back when he
needed to.</p>

<p>"But first I'll catch that goat," said Nero.</p>

<p>Carefully he stalked through the jungle, com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>ing
nearer and nearer to where he could hear
the goat bleating. At last, in an open place in
the jungle, where the moon shone brightly, Nero
saw the goat, a white one. It seemed caught
fast in a vine, and could not move.</p>

<p>"Ah, I can easily get this fellow!" thought the
boy lion.</p>

<p>He crouched for a spring, and was just going
to leap through the air and on the back of the
goat when, suddenly, there was a loud sound,
like a small clap of thunder, and at once Nero
felt a sharp pain in one paw. He rolled over
and over, howling and roaring in pain and anger.</p>

<p>At the same time a man hidden on a platform
built up in a tree, cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, I have shot a lion! I have shot a lion!"</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>NERO IN A CAVE</h3>

<p>Now while the hunter, hidden on a platform
in a tree in the jungle, was shouting
about having shot a lion, Nero was
doing some shouting of another sort. To tell
the truth, he was howling and roaring, just as,
sometimes, when you step on the puppy's tail,
by mistake, of course, the puppy howls. Nero
was howling and roaring with pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, what has happened? What is the matter?"
cried Nero, in lion talk, of course, as he
rolled over and over on the dried leaves of the
jungle. "What a terrible pain in my paw!
Oh, I wonder if the goat did this! If he did&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nero stopped his howling long enough to try
to stand up and look through the jungle trees to
where he had first seen the goat.</p>

<p>There the bleating animal was. It had not
moved.</p>

<p>"Surely that goat couldn't have given me the
pain in my paw," said Nero, between his howls.
"I wonder what the goat means by staying in
one place so long, especially when it must know
we lions are out on a night-hunt. And what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
gave me the pain in my foot, and what made the
loud noise?"</p>

<p>As Nero roared, so the other hunting lions
roared. Switchie and the smaller lions, like
Nero, could not roar very loudly, but Nero's
father, and the other full-grown beasts made the
very ground tremble with their rumblings.</p>

<p>At the same time there were other jungle cries
from other animals. The monkeys, who had
been sleeping in the tree-tops, began to chatter
and scold, as they swung to and fro.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What's the matter?"
asked one gray-haired monkey, who must have
been very old. "What's all the noise about?
It reminds me of the time a monkey named
Mappo, who once visited here, had the toothache
one night and howled until morning.
Some of you monkeys howl just like Mappo did,
though he was a merry chap most of the time."</p>

<p>"Where is Mappo now?" asked a small baboon,
which is another kind of monkey.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the gray-haired chap, "Mappo
went to a far country on a trip, and had many
wonderful adventures. He joined a circus, and
was put in a book."</p>

<p>"The lions are on a night-hunt," said a middle-sized
monkey, who climbed down a tree to take
a look. "The lions are hunting, and one of them
seems to be hurt, by the way he howls."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>"Very likely," said the old monkey. "I
thought I heard a gun. That means hunters are
about. I saw some of them in the jungle to-day,
but I kept out of sight. Well, if hunters are
hunting and lions are hunting, we monkeys had
better stay up in the trees."</p>

<p>And the monkeys did. But of course that did
not make the pain in Nero's foot any better.
The lion boy howled and roared by turns, and
with his big, rough, red tongue, <a name="licked" id="licked"></a>he licked the
place where his paw hurt. That is the only way
lions have of making well their sore places; by
licking them with their tongues or letting cold
water run on the hurt place. But just then there
was no water where Nero could get it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Nero?" roared
the voice of Mr. Lion through the black jungle.
"What are you howling about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm hurt!" said the lion boy. "I saw a
goat and tried to jump on it. Then I heard some
little thunder, and my paw hurt and the goat
is still there."</p>

<p>"Ha! That was a trap!" cried Mr. Lion.
"That goat was tied there to a tree by a rope, so
he would bleat and make you come closer.
Then a hunter, hidden in a tree, must have shot
you."</p>

<p>And this is exactly what had happened. The
hunter knew that a lion would come close to try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
to catch the tied goat, when it bleated, and the
man waited.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>Then, when the man, hiding on a platform
built in a tree, saw Nero, as the moon shone now
and then, he fired his big rifle. But he did not
kill a lion, as he thought. He only made Nero
lame in one paw, and as the lion boy rolled away
as quickly as he could the man lost sight of him.
And though he and some other hunters who were
with him tried later to find Nero, they could
not. He had run away; and I will tell you how
he did it.</p>

<p>"Come, lions!" called Nero's father to the
hunting band, when Nero had told what had
happened to him. "Come, we must not hunt
here any longer. If one hunter shot Nero, other
hunters may shoot at us. We had better hunt
somewhere else. Come, we will run away.
The jungle is big enough for us to hide from the
hunters. But, before we go, we will give a loud
roar so the hunters will know we are not afraid.
All ready now, my brothers. Roar! Roar!
Roar!"</p>

<p>And how those lions roared! You could have
heard them a mile away, for they all roared at
once, and the ground fairly trembled. Even
Nero, hurt as he was, helped in the roaring.</p>

<p>"Come on now, Nero! Follow us!" called
Mr. Lion to the boy cub who was shot. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
will have to run on three legs, but you have done
that before. You did it once when you got a big
thorn in your paw. Come along, follow us and
we will hunt in another part of the jungle."</p>

<p>So the lion band turned away from the place
where the goat was tied and where the hunters
were hidden, and Nero followed. But it was
not easy for the cub lion, and soon he began to
limp and fall behind.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Switchie, as he
saw that his chum was not keeping up with the
rest. "Can't you run along faster?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't," answered Nero. "And I guess
you couldn't either, on only three legs."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I couldn't," replied Switchie.
"I'm sorry you were shot, Nero. I'll stay behind
and walk with you. Then you won't be
lonesome."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Nero, using lion talk,
of course.</p>

<p>So Switchie stayed behind with Nero, going
slowly, as the wounded lion had to go. But
soon the others&mdash;the big and little lions who were
not hurt began to get far ahead.</p>

<p>"Come on, Nero! Come on!" they roared.
"And you too, Switchie! Come along here!
Hurry up!"</p>

<p>"I'll just run on ahead and see what they
want," said Switchie to Nero. "I'll tell them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
you can't go fast, and that they must wait for
us. I'll run up ahead and tell them this, and
then come back here to you."</p>

<p>"All right, thank you, I wish you would,"
growled Nero, and he did not feel very happy,
for his paw hurt him very much. "I'll wait here
for you," he said, as he sat down on a pile of
leaves.</p>

<p>So Switchie ran on ahead to tell the others.
But while he was gone something happened that
changed Nero's whole life, and really was the
cause of his going to a circus.</p>

<p>I'll tell you about it.</p>

<p>As Nero sat on the pile of leaves, waiting for
his friend Switchie to come back, he suddenly
heard a noise in the jungle behind him. He saw
some lights flashing and he heard the sound of
talk. It was the voices of men&mdash;the same sort
of voice that had shouted:</p>

<p>"I have shot a lion!"</p>

<p>Nero pricked up his ears and listened as hard
as he could.</p>

<p>"Those are hunters!" said the boy lion to himself.
"They are coming after me! I must run
away and hide! I can't wait for Switchie to
come back! I must hide!"</p>

<p>As I have said, the moon now and then shone
in the jungle, making it light enough for men to
see to shoot. But the lights Nero saw flashing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
were not moonbeams. They came from lanterns
carried by the hunters.</p>

<p>"Here is a mark where a lion has been!" cried
one hunter, flashing his light. "This must be the
one I shot! Come on, we'll get him yet!"</p>

<p>And these were the voices Nero heard. The
wounded lion boy did not wait any longer. Up
he sprang, and, running on three legs, and making
no noise, off through the dark jungle he hurried.
His only idea was to get away and hide.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nero saw a blacker patch in the half
darkness. He knew at once what it was. It
was the opening, or front door, of a cave.</p>

<p>"It isn't the cave where I live," thought the
lion boy, "but it will do very well for me to hide
in."</p>

<p>So Nero crawled into the cave with his sore
paw, and lay down on some dried grass, as far
back as he could get. And the hunters, with
their guns and lanterns, came on through the
jungle, looking for a lion to kill.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>NERO IN A TRAP</h3>

<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp came the hunters
through the jungle, flashing their lights
and looking for the lion which one of
them had shot while the hunter was hidden on
the platform in a tree. But Nero, cowering
away back in the dark cave, kept very still and
quiet, and he heard the hunters walk right past
his hiding place.</p>

<p>"Good!" thought the boy lion. "They haven't
found me! I'm all right so far; but I wonder
how long I will have to stay here, and what the
other lions will do."</p>

<p>Poor Nero felt sick and in pain, and he was
lonesome. It's as bad, I think, for a jungle lion
to be this way as it would be for your dog. But
still Nero did not dare come out of the cave for
fear of the hunters.</p>

<p>"I'll just have to stay here," thought Nero,
"until it's safe to come out. Guess I might as
well go to sleep."</p>

<p>So Nero curled up on the dried grass in the
cave. He knew some other lion once must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
used the same cave for a sleeping place, as the
grass bed was made up just as Nero's was in
the home cave.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing I found this place," thought
Nero. "But I wish my father and mother and
Chet and Boo were here with me. Yes, and I
even wish Switchie were here. I wonder what
he is doing!"</p>

<p>And so, wondering, Nero fell asleep in the
jungle cave. How long he slept he did not
know, for it was as dark as night in the cavern,
no matter whether or not the sun shone outside,
and Nero was far back from the front door of
the cave. When Nero awakened he tried to
stand up and walk.</p>

<p>But the moment he put his sore paw down on
the stone floor of the cave, he felt such a pain that
he let out a howl and then a roar. But as soon
as he had done this he knew he had better keep
quiet.</p>

<p>"For the hunters may be around the cave yet,
outside, and may hear me," thought Nero. "But,
oh, how my foot hurts!"</p>

<p>And indeed it did, for it was all swelled up
because of the bullet that had gone in from the
hunter's gun. Nero could not step on his paw,
and he had to limp around on three legs.</p>

<p>"I can't go out of the cave while I'm this way,"
he thought. "I could not run very fast through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
the jungle, and if the hunters were to see me,
lame as I am, they surely would catch me."</p>

<p>Nero knew something about the hunters in
the African jungle, for he had often heard his
father and the other lions talk about the men with
guns. Some of the older lions had even been
shot at, and one or two of them had scars on
them, to show where the bullets had gone in.
But the shot places had healed. And among the
stories the older lions told when they came to
the cave where Nero lived, were tales of lion
friends who had gone out on jungle hunts and
had never returned.</p>

<p>"What happened to them?" Nero asked one
day.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose some of them were killed dead
by a gun," said old Bounder, a toothless lion who
could chew only soft scraps of meat. "Others
must have been caught in traps and taken away."</p>

<p>And Nero thought of this talk as he licked his
sore paw in the jungle cave. What had happened
to him was exactly like what had happened
to some of the lions Bounder used to
know.</p>

<p>"But I am still here," thought Nero; "and
when my father or Switchie comes to find me
they will know what has happened to me. But
I wish they would hurry!"</p>

<p>Nero hopped on three legs about the cave.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
He was very thirsty, as all animals are after a
meal and a sleep, and, besides, he was hot and
feverish from his hurt paw. He wanted a drink
very much.</p>

<p>Now, when a wild animal wants a drink of
water he does not do as you boys and girls can
do&mdash;go to a faucet or the pump and get a drink.
Lions in the jungle can't get water whenever
they want it, and the only way they have of telling
where some may be&mdash;that is unless they live
near a spring or a pool&mdash;is by smelling.</p>

<p>And so Nero began sniffing to see if he could
smell water in the cave, as he knew he dared not
go outside. And pretty soon, to his delight, he
caught the sweet smell of a spring. He walked
in the direction from which the smell came, and
soon he heard the trickle of water. And, a little
later, he came to a small spring in the far end
of the cave. There was a little pool of water,
and Nero took a big drink. Then he let some
of the cool water run on his paw, and this made
the hurt place feel better.</p>

<p>Nero's foot was so sore that he could not go
out of the cave for two days, for it was all he
could do to limp around in the cavern and get
drinks of water. He dared not go outside.
And in these two days he became very hungry,
so that at last he felt that he must go out and see
if he could not find some meat to eat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>Very carefully he poked his head outside the
cave. The sun was shining brightly in the
jungle, and it was nice and warm. Nero looked
this way and that for a sign of a hunter, but he
saw none. Then, a little distance off, he saw a
small animal eating some leaves.</p>

<p>"There is my dinner if I can only get it," said
Nero to himself. "I must try and see how much
of a hunter I shall make on three legs."</p>

<p>Carefully, as he had been taught by his father
and mother, and as he had done on the night of
the big hunt when he had been hurt, Nero began
to creep toward the small animal. And he
caught it, too, in spite of his sore paw.</p>

<p>"Now I feel better!" said Nero, after his meal.
"I think it will be all right to stay out of the cave
for a while. I can get along better than at first,
and the hunters do not seem to be around here.
I'll go to the home cave now, and I'll have a great
story to tell the others."</p>

<p>But Nero was not going to find it as easy to get
home through the jungle as he had hoped. In
the first place, he did not know his way, and, in
the second place, he had to go very slowly. For
his paw, though it was getting better, was not
well yet, and sometimes, when he knocked it
against a stone or a tree, it pained him so that
he would have to sit down and rumble and roar
and howl. But he did not howl very loudly, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
this might have brought the hunters, who, he
feared, might try to shoot him again.</p>

<p>As I have said, Nero did not know his way
back home through the jungle. It had been
dark when he started out with his father on the
night-hunt, and he had not noticed the way they
had slunk along. Then, too, Nero expected his
father would be with him to show him the way
back. But something had happened, as you
know, to make everything different. And when
Nero ran away from the hunters, and hid in the
cave, he had gone farther and farther away from
his own folks and home, though, at the time, he
did not know it.</p>

<p>"If only I can get back to my own cave I'll be
all right," thought the lion boy. "I must try
as hard as I can to find my cave. And how I do
wish I could see my father and mother, and Boo
and Chet!"</p>

<p>So Nero wandered to and fro in the jungle,
now and then stopping to drink from a pool or
a spring, and when he was hungry he hunted
small animals, that he could easily catch. He
did not dare to go after big animals when his
paw was so sore.</p>

<p>"If I should see a buffalo now, I'd have to run
away from him," thought Nero. "But when I
get well, and bigger and stronger, I'll jump on
a buffalo's back, just as my father did!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>So Nero wandered on and on in the jungle,
but he did not find the home cave for which he
was looking. Here and there wandered the boy
lion, always hoping that he might find some animal
path that would lead him home. But he
did not. Day after day passed, and Nero was
no nearer home than at first.</p>

<p>Then he began to know what had happened.</p>

<p>"I am lost!" he thought. "I have lost my
way. I must ask some of the jungle animals how
to get home."</p>

<p>But this was not easy. Most of the jungle
animals were afraid of the lion, though he was
not yet full grown, and when he roared at them,
to ask where his cave was, they thought he was
trying to scare them or catch them, and they ran
away.</p>

<p>The larger animals, like the elephants, who
went about in herds, and who were not afraid of
one lion who was all alone, did not bother to
answer Nero, or else they said they knew nothing
of his home.</p>

<p>"Do you know where I live?" asked poor, lost
Nero of the monkeys he saw hopping about in
the trees. "Where is my home cave? And
where are Boo and Chet?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," answered the monkeys.
"All we know is that we sit in the trees and eat
coconuts when we can get them. We never saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
your cave, and, besides, we don't like lions, anyhow."</p>

<p>Poor Nero did not know what to do, so he
wandered on, eating when he could, and drinking
when he came to a pool or a spring.</p>

<p>"If I could only meet some other lions one of
them would take me home," he thought.</p>

<p>But the part of the jungle where Nero now
was did not seem to have any lions in it except
himself. By this time his paw was nearly well,
and he could run about almost as fast as at first.</p>

<p>Once Nero came to a spring when he was very
thirsty, and, as he was drinking, having driven
away a lot of monkeys who were taking up the
water in their paws and sipping it, all at once he
felt himself knocked over as he had been knocked
by the crocodile that time.</p>

<p>"Here! Who's doing that?" asked Nero, as
he got up from the dust, where he had been
knocked. "Who did that?"</p>

<p>"I did!" answered a loud voice, and, looking
toward the spring, Nero saw an animal the color
of an elephant, but not half as large. And on
the end of his nose, or snout, the animal had two
sharp horns, not as long, though, as the tusks of
an elephant.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you knocked me away from the spring,
did you?" asked Nero.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>"Yes, I did," was the answer. "Don't you
know better than to drink before me?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"I am the two-horned rhinoceros," was the
answer. "And the only jungle folk who can
drink with me, or before me, are the elephants.
A hippopotamus can, too, as a hippo, which is
his short name, is a friend of mine. But, as they
live in the water nearly all the time, they don't
have to come to a jungle pool to drink. I had
a friend once, named Chunky. He was a happy
hippo, and he and I used to drink together."</p>

<p>"What became of him?" asked Nero. He
was not angry with the rhinoceros for having
knocked him away from the water. That was
the law of the jungle, just as Nero had driven
away the monkeys.</p>

<p>"What became of Chunky? Oh, he ran away
and joined a circus, I believe," answered the
rhinoceros.</p>

<p>"What's a circus?" Nero wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't bother me," replied the two-horned
animal. "I am too thirsty to talk," and
he drank a lot of water. Then, when he went
away, it was Nero's turn. And after the lion
had quenched his thirst he thought of asking the
rhinoceros the way to the lost cave. But the
rhinoceros was gone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>"I guess I'll have to find my own way home,"
thought poor Nero, as he wandered on and on in
the jungle.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed, and though Nero grew
bigger and stronger, he was still a lion cub. And
he was very lonesome and homesick, because he
could not find his cave. Then, one day, something
happened&mdash;something very important.</p>

<p>Nero was very hungry, not having been able
to get anything to eat for a long time, when, all
at once, he smelled something good. It was
meat&mdash;just what he wanted&mdash;and, looking along
a jungle path used by wild animals, he saw, lying
on a pile of leaves, a chunk of goat flesh.</p>

<p>"Ah, there is a meal for me!" thought Nero,
and then, his paw being well again, he gave a
spring, and landed right on the meat.</p>

<p>But something very strange happened.
Nero suddenly felt himself falling down.
Down and down he went, into a big hole, and the
meat and the pile of leaves went with him.
Down into a black pit fell Nero, and, as he toppled
in, a black African man shouted:</p>

<p>"Ha! The lion is in the trap! The lion is
in my trap!"</p>

<h3>NERO IN A CIRCUS</h3>

<p>Nero did not know what had happened
to him, except that he had fallen down
into a big hole dug in the earth. He
did not know what the black African man said
about being in a "trap," for though Nero could
understand lion talk, he did not yet know much
about the talk of men. Later on he was to learn
a little about that. Just now he was frightened
and hurt, for when he fell down the hole he had
struck his paw that had the bullet in it, and,
though the sore was healed, it still pained a bit
at times.</p>

<p>"I wonder what can have happened to me,"
thought Nero, as he tumbled and twisted about
on the bottom of the pit, which was partly filled
with dried leaves. "I wonder what this is, anyhow!"</p>

<p>More than once, when a very little lion boy
and out walking along the jungle paths with his
father and mother, Nero had fallen into a mud
puddle or other hole, because he had not yet
learned to walk steadily and carefully. But at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
such times he had easily scrambled out of the
hole, or his mother had helped him.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Lion was not here to do this, and,
try as he did, Nero could not get out of this hole.
It was too deep, and the sides were too straight.
Nero tried hard enough, jumping up and clawing
at the dirt, some of which got into his eyes, but
jump though he did, and roar though he did, he
could not get out.</p>

<p>Up on top, at the edge of the hole, the black
African man was jumping about, waving his
hands, in one of which was a long, sharp spear,
and the African was shouting:</p>

<p>"I have caught a lion! I have a lion in my
hole-trap! Whoop-la!"</p>

<p>Of course Nero did not know what all this
meant. All he knew was that a man had something
to do with his trouble.</p>

<p>"Maybe that is the hunter man who shot me,"
thought Nero; "and now he has caught me because
I ran away from him and hid in the cave.
Well, he has caught me at last, unless I can get
out of this hole."</p>

<p>But Nero was wrong. This was not the same
man who had shot him. This was another man,
a trapper of wild animals, and he had dug a deep
hole along a jungle path where he knew lions and
other animals would walk. Then he covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
the hole with little sticks and leaves, so they
would easily break if a big animal, like Nero,
jumped on them.</p>

<p>And that is just what Nero had done. He saw
the piece of meat on the ground, and jumped
straight for it. But he landed in the middle of
the sticks and leaves, and fell into the hole.</p>

<p>That is how Nero was caught, and he did not
like it at all. He wanted to be loose, to roam
through the jungle as he liked. He wanted to
try to find his father and his mother and Chet
and Boo. But they were far away.</p>

<p>And, while I think of it, I might tell you that
for a long time after Nero was lost, that night
of the hunt, Mr. Lion looked everywhere for the
boy lion. But Nero could not be found, and his
father and mother and the other lions thought he
had been killed by the hunters. They never saw
him again, and, for a time, felt very sad. But so
many things happened in the jungle that Mr. and
Mrs. Lion soon forgot Nero. That's the way
with animals. They are not like us. And so it
was that Nero's father and mother never really
knew what happened to him. They might find
out if they could read this book, but that, of
course, can't be done.</p>

<p>Now we'll get back to Nero. There he was
in the bottom of a big hole, and up at the top was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
the black African trapper looking down on him.
Pretty soon other hunters and trappers came to
see the lion that had been caught alive.</p>

<p>"He's a fine big fellow, Chaki," said one black
man to the trapper who had been so pleased
when Nero was caught. "What are you going
to do with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am going to sell him to a white animal
man who comes from across the sea in a big boat
called a ship," answered Chaki, the trapper.</p>

<p>"And what will the white animal man do with
a live lion?"</p>

<p>"He buys him to sell to a circus," answered
Chaki.</p>

<p>"And what is a circus?" asked the other black
man.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Chaki, "except that
far across the ocean white people like to pay
money to look at wild animals such as we have
in our jungle. That's all I know about a circus.
The white animal man told me that."</p>

<p>"Ha! A circus!" laughed the other black
man. "And people pay money to look at wild
animals? Well, they should come to the jungle.
They could see all the animals they want for
nothing."</p>

<p>And of course we could, I suppose, only very
few of us can go to jungles, and so we go to circuses
instead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>Nero, down on the bottom of the hole, listened
to the talk of the black men up above. He did
not understand any of it, or he might have remembered
that word "circus." The rhinoceros,
who had knocked him away from the drinking
pool, had spoken of a "circus" where Chunky, the
happy hippo, went. But Nero was too frightened
and in too much pain to pay any heed to
what the men said.</p>

<p>And then began a very unhappy time for our
lion friend. It was such an unhappy, sad time
that I am not going to tell you very much about
this part of Nero's life. I'm going to skip over
it and come to the funnier, happier part.</p>

<p>For, after the lion had thrashed about on the
bottom of the pit for some time, the black African
trapper let down ropes and tangled the
lion all up in them. Then Nero was hauled to
the top of the pit and put into a big wooden cage.
He tried to get out, by striking the bars with his paws, and biting them with his teeth, but they
were too strong. Then he lay down in a corner
of his cage and shut his eyes. He did not like
to look out through the bars at the jungle, when
he could no longer roam about as he liked. Poor
Nero was a prisoner&mdash;a caged wild animal.</p>

<p>For many days Nero was kept in the cage in
the jungle near the hut of the black trapper. At
first the lion would not eat, but at last he grew so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
hungry that he had to take some of the meat they
thrust through the bars of the cage to him. And
when he had eaten and taken some water, Nero
felt better. But he was still cross and unhappy,
and whenever any of the black Africans came
near his cage Nero would suddenly stick out his
paws and try to scratch them. But they knew
enough to keep out of his way.</p>

<p>Then, one day, Nero felt his cage being suddenly
lifted up on long poles, which the black
men put across their shoulders, and so they carried
the caged lion through the jungle. They
wouldn't trust Nero to walk by himself. What
had happened was that the white animal man,
who bought wild animals for his circus, had
come along, and, seeing that Nero was a fine
lion, had taken him to be sent away across the
ocean, from Africa to the United States of
America, where there were many circuses.</p>

<p>Nero, still in his cage, was put on board a ship.
He was stowed away down in a deep, black hole,
deeper and blacker than the jungle pit into which
he had fallen, and then began a sea voyage.</p>

<p>Nero didn't like this a bit. Sometimes he
seemed to be standing on his head, and again he
would be on his feet. At other times he seemed
to roll over and over in a regular somersault.
And these somersaults weren't at all like the ones
he used to turn by accident, when he was playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
tag in the jungle with his brother and sister, or
with Switchie.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I don't like this at all!" grumbled
Nero, in his cage in the ship. "I wish I could
go back to the jungle. Oh, here I go again&mdash;upside
down!"</p>

<p>And over he went, cage and all. What was
happening was that the ship was in a big storm,
and was being tossed up and down on great
ocean waves, and that Nero's cage had got loose
and was being flung about.</p>

<p>Our lion friend was seasick, and he had a
dreadful time. More than once he wished himself
back in the jungle, but he could not get there.</p>

<p>After many days the ship stopped tossing to
and fro. It had crossed to the other side, with
Nero on board, and was now tied up at a dock
in New York. Then Nero felt himself being
hoisted up in his cage, and, for the first time in
many days, he saw the sun again and smelled
fresh air. And, oh, how good it was!</p>

<p>It was not like the air of the jungle, for it was
cooler, and Nero had been used to being very
hot nearly all the time. But he did not mind
being a bit cool.</p>

<p>Nero's cage was hoisted out of the hold, the
deep, black hold of the ship, and slung on a big
automobile truck with some boxes and barrels.
Nero was the only wild animal, and people pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>ing
along on the dock stopped to look into the
big wooden cage at the tawny yellow lion who
had been brought all the way from the jungle.</p>

<p>Away started the auto-truck, giving Nero a
new kind of ride. He would much rather have
walked, but of course a lion can't go about loose
in the streets of New York, though they do let
the elephants and camels walk in a circus parade.
But Nero was not yet in a circus.</p>

<p><a name="looked" id="looked"></a>Nero looked out through the bars of his cage
as he was carted through the streets of New
York.</p>

<p>"My, this is a queer jungle!" thought the lion.
"Where are the trees and the tangled vines and
the snakes and monkeys and other animals? All
I see are men and other queer creatures. This
isn't at all like my jungle!"</p>

<p>And of course it was not, being a big city.
There are not many places for trees in a city,
you know.</p>

<p>So Nero cowered down in the corner of his
cage until he was put in a freight car to be sent
to a place called Bridgeport, Connecticut, where
some circus men keep their wild animals, to
train them, and have them safe during the winter
when it is too cold to give shows in the big, white
tents.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a new sort of motion," thought
Nero, as the train started off. "I don't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
that I like it, but still it is better than being made
to turn somersaults all the while."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>Indeed it was easier riding on a train than
in a ship; at least for Nero. He knew nothing
about railroads, nor where he was being taken.
But, after a while, during which he did not get
much to eat or drink, once more his cage was
put on a big auto-truck.</p>

<p>A little later, after being lifted about, and
slung here and there, Nero suddenly saw one end
of his cage open. The wooden bars, which had
been around him ever since he had left the jungle,
seemed to drop away.</p>

<p>"Ha! Now, maybe, I can get loose!" thought
Nero.</p>

<p>He sprang forward, but, to his surprise, he
found himself in very much the same sort of
place. But this new cage was larger, and the
bars were of iron instead of wood.</p>

<p>Looking through them Nero could see many
other just such cages. He sniffed, and he
smelled the smell of many wild animals which
he knew. He smelled lions, buffaloes, and elephants.</p>

<p>Nero looked around him. He was in a big
wooden building, and over to one side were some
elephants. At first Nero could not believe it.
He rubbed his eyes with his paw and looked
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>Yes, surely enough, they were elephants.
They were swaying slowly to and fro, as elephants
always sway, and they were stuffing hay
into their mouths with their curling trunks.</p>

<p>"Oh, am I back in the jungle?" asked Nero
aloud, speaking in animal talk.</p>

<p>"The jungle? No, I should say not!" cried
a big jolly-looking elephant. "This isn't the
jungle."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"It's a circus," said the elephant. "This is
a circus, and we are glad to have you with us,
jungle lion. My name is Tum Tum, what is
yours?"</p>

<p>"Nero," was the answer. "And so this is a
circus!" went on the lion. "Well, well! I
never thought I'd be here!"</p>

<h3>NERO LEARNS SOME TRICKS</h3>

<p>Nero thought the circus a very queer
place indeed. It was as queer to him
as the wild jungle would be to you if
you saw it for the first time. But strange as it
was, the circus, where he now found himself,
seemed much nicer to Nero than being cooped
up in the dark ship or in the freight car.</p>

<p>For there were many wild animals in the circus&mdash;other
lions, tigers, elephants, camels, giraffes,
several cages of monkeys, some wolves,
a bear or two, and others that Nero did not see
until later. And there was also a queer, wild-animal
smell, which Nero liked very much. It
was almost like the smell of the jungle, and it
made him homesick when he thought of the deep
tangle of green vines, the thick trees and the silent
pools of water.</p>

<p>"We are glad to have you in our circus," said
the elephant, who had called himself Tum Tum,
speaking to Nero. "Of course it isn't very
lively now, but wait until we get out on the
road, giving a show every day in a new place,
and traveling about! Then you'll like it!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>"Doesn't the circus stay here every day?"
asked Nero, as he looked across to another lion
in a cage. Nero hoped this lion would speak to
him, but the big fellow seemed to be asleep.</p>

<p>"The circus stay here? I should say not!"
cried Tum Tum, speaking through his long
trunk. "Why, this is only the winter barn,
where we stay when the weather is cold. We
don't have any shows in winter. The people
don't come in to see us, and we don't do any of
our tricks. It is only when the show goes on
the road in summer, with the big white tent, all
covered with gay flags, and the bands playing
music, that we have the good times. Here
we just rest, eat, and sometimes learn new
tricks."</p>

<p>"Tricks!" exclaimed Nero. "Tricks? Are
they something good to eat?"</p>

<p>"Tricks good to eat!" laughed Tum Tum in
his jolly voice. "No indeed! Tricks are
things you do. But often, after we do ours well,
the trainer gives us good things to eat."</p>

<p>"I fell into a big hole in the jungle once," said
Nero. "Is that a trick?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," answered Tum Tum. "Here,
I'll show you what a trick is. This is only one of
my easy ones, though," and then suddenly the big
elephant stood on his hind legs, waving his trunk
in the air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>"Oh, so that's a trick," said Nero. "Well, I
could do that."</p>

<p>But when he tried to stand up on his hind legs
in his cage he could not. He had not learned
how to balance himself.</p>

<p>"So you do tricks in a circus, do you?" went
on Nero. "That reminds me. In the jungle
I heard some monkeys speak of a circus, and also
of a chap named Mappo. Is he here?"</p>

<p>"He used to be," said Tum Tum. "Mappo
was one of our merriest monkeys. We all liked
him, but he went to live with some people. I
don't know where he is now. But he was in this
circus. And to think of your meeting some of
his friends in the jungle! Tell me, did you see
any of mine?"</p>

<p>"Well, I met lots of elephants," answered
Nero, "but I didn't have much time to stop and
talk with them. I met a rhinoceros, though, and
he said something about Chunky, a happy hippo,
who used to live in the jungle near him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Chunky is here, in this very circus!"
cried Tum Tum. "But he stays in a water-tank,
so we don't very often see him. He'll be glad
to know you met his rhinoceros friend. I'll tell
him the first time I get a chance. But, speaking
of tricks, there's a chap over there who does some
fine ones," and Tum Tum pointed with his trunk
to a cage in which was a shaggy, black animal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>"Who is it?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"Dido, the dancing bear," answered the elephant.
"He dances on a platform, which is
strapped to my back out in the circus rings; he
jumps through a hoop of blazing fire; and he
turns somersaults."</p>

<p>"I turned some somersaults too, after they put
me in a cage and brought me from the jungle,"
said Nero, as he thought of his voyage on the ship.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you can learn to do them here,
and that will be a trick," returned Tum Tum.
"But you should see Dido, the dancing bear. He
surely can dance!"</p>

<p>"Who is talking about me?" asked the shaggy
creature in the other cage.</p>

<p>"We are, Dido," answered Tum Tum. "I
was just telling the new lion how you dance on
a platform over my back."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the bear, opening wide his
mouth and showing his red tongue. "And I
wish I could soon start to doing that again. I
am getting tired of the circus barn. I want to
be out in the tent."</p>

<p>"It will soon be warm enough," said Tum
Tum. "Summer will soon be here, and then we
shall have hot weather."</p>

<p>"Does it get as hot as in the jungle?" Nero
asked.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," answered the jolly elephant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
"But here comes your keeper, I guess. He is
going to give you some meat."</p>

<p>And, surely enough, along came a circus man
with a big chunk of meat on a large, iron fork.
He poked the meat in through the bars of the
cage to Nero, and the lion was so hungry that he
began eating at once.</p>

<p>The man who had fed him stood in front of
the cage, looking at Nero.</p>

<p>"You look like a fine chap," said the man,
talking partly to himself and partly to the jungle
animal. "I think we shall be good friends, and
I will teach you some tricks. Then the boys
and girls who come to the circus will want to
watch you. Yes, I'll teach you some tricks.
Come, let's be friends."</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully the circus trainer reached
his hand toward Nero's paw, which was between
two bars and partly outside the cage.
Nero, looking out of the corners of his eyes as
he gnawed the bone and chewed the meat, did
not know what the man was trying to do. Perhaps
the lion thought that the man was trying
to take away the meat.</p>

<p>Whatever he thought, Nero suddenly jumped
up and struck with all his force at the man's
hand. But the man was too quick. He pulled
his hand out of the way, and Nero's paw hit the
iron bars. And as it happened to be the paw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
that had been struck by the bullet, Nero felt
great pain, for the bullet was still in the flesh,
though healed over.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" cried Nero, in lion language.</p>

<p>"That will teach you not to strike at me when
I am only trying to pat you and be kind to you,"
said the man with a laugh. "You are beginning
to learn things, my lion friend."</p>

<p>The man stayed for some time in front of
Nero's cage, talking kindly to the lion, but Nero
paid no attention to him. He only ate the meat.
Then, when it was all gone, Nero felt thirsty.</p>

<p>"I'll get you some water," said the man, and
he did.</p>

<p>"Well, you are kind to me, anyhow," thought
Nero, "even if you did try to take away my
bone," but of course the man had not tried to
do that.</p>

<p>For about a week Nero lived in his circus cage
in the big barn, where the animals were kept
warm all winter. Nothing much happened, except
that the same man, every day, brought food
and water to the wild jungle lion. And by this
time Nero was not so wild as he had been at
first. He gave up trying to break the iron bars
with his paws, and no longer tried to bite them
with his teeth. They were too strong for him.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the trainer man came again to
the lion's cage, with a nice, sweet piece of meat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>"My, how good that is!" said Nero to himself,
as he ate it.</p>

<p>As Nero was chewing away, the man slowly
put out his hand toward the lion's paw, which
was out between the bars. But Nero saw him,
and again the old fear came back that the man
was going to take away the meat, and Nero did
not want that to happen.</p>

<p>"Look out!" roared Nero, in lion talk. "Look
out or I'll scratch you!"</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" said another voice. A voice
that Nero knew came from the other lion cage,
that had recently been moved up near his.
"Don't be silly, Nero!" said the other circus
lion, whose name was Leo. "I used to be as
wild as you are, and live in the jungle. But
they caught me and brought me here to the circus;
and now I like it very much. I, too, tried
to scratch the man when he wanted to touch my
paw, but I learned better. So must you. The
man is your friend. He will feed you and give
you water to drink. So don't scratch him. He
only wants to pat you and rub you."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if he only wants to do that, all
right," said Nero. "He can do that. I thought
he wanted to take my meat."</p>

<p>And then, when the man saw that Nero was
quieting down, he reached out his hand again,
and this time he touched Nero's big paw, with its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
sharp claws. One blow of it would have broken
the man's arm, but Nero did not strike the blow.
He had learned that the man would not hurt him.</p>

<p>And a few days after this Nero and the
trainer had become such good friends that the
man could open the iron door and go inside
Nero's cage and the lion would only blink his
big eyes, and not even growl. He had learned
that the man would not hurt him.</p>

<p>And so Nero's circus lessons began. The
first one he learned was leaping over a long stick
which the man held stretched out in the cage.
At the beginning Nero did not know what the
stick was for, but he could see that the man did
not intend to strike him with it.</p>

<p>The trainer kept bringing the stick nearer
and nearer to Nero, who backed into the corner
of the cage. At last the lion could back no
farther, as he was close against the wall of the
cage.</p>

<p>"Well, if he doesn't take that stick out of my
way I'll jump right over it!" said Nero to himself.
And that is just what he did, and the
man clapped his hands in delight, and cried:</p>

<p>"There! You have learned your first trick!
That's fine! Now I must teach you more!"</p>

<p>Nero was fast becoming a regular circus lion.</p>

<h3>NERO MEETS DON</h3>

<p>One day when Nero awoke in his circus
cage, which stood in the big winter
barn, the lion saw that something very
different was going on from what had happened
since he had been brought there from the jungle.
Men were running to and fro, and the first thing
Nero noticed was that Tum Tum, the jolly elephant,
and all the other big animals with the
long trunks were gone.</p>

<p>"Why, where is Tum Tum?" asked Nero of
Leo, his lion friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's out with the other elephants, pushing
wagon cages about the lot," said Leo.</p>

<p>"Pushing cages?" repeated Nero. "Is that a
circus trick?"</p>

<p>"No, that is part of the circus work," answered
Leo. "The elephants are so big and
strong that they are used instead of horses, sometimes,
to push the circus cages."</p>

<p>"But why is Tum Tum helping push the circus
cages?" asked Nero. "Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, something is going to happen," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
Leo. "The circus is going to start out on the
road&mdash;we are going to travel from town to town.
We are going to travel on the railroad and live
in a tent instead of this barn. We shall see lots
of people&mdash;boys and girls&mdash;who come to watch
us eat, and do tricks, and we shall hear the band
music and&mdash;Oh, it's real jolly!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," said Nero. "I like to be
jolly. But will Tum Tum come back?" he
asked, for he liked the big, jolly elephant, as, indeed,
all the circus animals did.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Tum Tum will come back," answered
Dido, the dancing bear. "The circus
couldn't get along without him. And I couldn't
do some of my best tricks if Tum Tum didn't
walk around the ring with the wooden platform
on his back for me to dance on. Oh, we couldn't
get along without Tum Tum!"</p>

<p>Nero was glad to hear this. Though he liked
Leo, his lion friend, and the other animals, even
the queer-looking camels, Nero felt more
friendly toward Tum Tum than toward any one
else in the circus except his trainer. For, by this
time, Nero had grown to like very much the man
who fed him, and who came into the cage every
day to make the lion jump over the stick.</p>

<p>But Nero had learned many more tricks than
this first, easy one. He did not learn the other
tricks as quickly, for they were harder, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
lion could sit up on a big wooden stool, he could
stand up on his hind paws, and he would open
his mouth very wide when his trainer told him
to. In a way Nero had learned something of
man-talk, too, for he knew what certain words
meant.</p>

<p>The trainer would call:</p>

<p>"Jump over the stick, Nero!"</p>

<p>The lion knew what that meant, and he knew
it was different from the words used when the
trainer said:</p>

<p>"Sit on your stool!"</p>

<p>So, though of course Nero could not understand
what the circus men said when they talked
to one another, the lion had learned some words.
So he could talk and understand animal language,
and he could also understand some words
of man-talk. And that is pretty good, I think,
for a lion who had not been out of the jungle
quite a year.</p>

<p>"Shall we have to push any of the cages?"
asked Nero of his friend Leo, as they both
watched the circus men hurrying to and fro in
the big barn.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered the older lion. "They
never let us out of the cages."</p>

<p>"And a good reason, too," declared a humpy
camel, near by. "If they let you lions and tigers
out of the cages, you'd run away. We wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
do that. We camels are well-behaved, like the
horses and the elephants."</p>

<p>Leo, the old lion, shook his head until his
mane dangled in his eyes.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "if they opened my cage, I
wouldn't run away. I wouldn't even go out,
unless it was to get something to eat and come
right back again."</p>

<p>"I would!" growled Nero. "I'd go out in
a minute, if they opened my cage door wide
enough. I'd go out and run back to the jungle."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I used to think, at first,"
growled Leo. "But after you've been in the
circus awhile you get used to it. It's home to
you.</p>

<p>"Why, I remember, Nero, we once had in this
circus a lion just about like you. He always
said he'd run away if he got the chance. Well,
one day his cage was left open by accident, and
he ran away."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"Well, he ran back again, the next day, and
a more sorry or sick-looking lion you never saw!
He was bedraggled and lame and hungry and
thirsty! He said he was glad to get back to his
cage, and he never left it again."</p>

<p>"What had happened to him?" asked the
camel. "I guess that was before my time."</p>

<p>"Oh, no sooner was he loose in the streets,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
said Leo, "than he was chased by men and boys,
who threw rocks and sticks at him. They were
afraid of him, and tried to drive him away.
But the circus men tried to catch the runaway
lion, and, between both, poor Tarsus, which was
his name, had a bad time. He had enough of
running away."</p>

<p>"He should have gone back to the jungle,"
said Nero. "That's what I'd do if I could get
loose."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think you would!" growled Leo.
"But the jungle is far away from here. You
could never reach it. No, you had much better
stay here in the circus, Nero. Here you are in
a cage, it is true, but you are warm, you have
a good place to sleep, you have plenty to eat
and drink, and boys can not throw stones at
you."</p>

<p>But Nero only switched his tail to and fro,
thought of the jungle where he had played with
Boo and Chet, and said to himself:</p>

<p>"That's all right. But, even though my
trainer is kind to me, if ever I get the chance
I'll run away!"</p>

<p>And so the circus got ready to go out on the
road. Tum Tum and the other elephants
pushed the animal cages about, and one day
Nero saw the big elephant come close up to the
lion's cage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>"What are you going to do, Tum Tum?"
asked Nero.</p>

<p>"It is time for your cage to be moved," said
the elephant. "I am going to push you out on
the lot, and there horses will be hitched to your
cage and you will be given a ride."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope the ride will be nice," said the
lion.</p>

<p>"You'll like it," said Tum Tum, trumpeting
through his trunk.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Nero found himself, in his cage,
out in the bright sunshine. It was a warm day,
and the lion stretched, opened his mouth as wide
as he could, and then lay down in his cage where
the sun could warm his back.</p>

<p>"It feels just as good as the jungle," thought
Nero. "But of course there aren't as many trees,
and there are no pools of water, and I haven't
Switchie or Chet or Boo to play with. A circus
may be nice, but I'll run away the first chance
I get."</p>

<p>Tum Tum pushed Nero's cage about until
some horses could be hitched to it to draw it to
the railroad station. For the circus was to
travel on a train of cars to the city where it was
first to give a show.</p>

<p>Nero's cage, as well as other cages, were put
on a big flat car, and when the engine started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
puffing and pulling away, and when Nero felt
the motion of the train, he called to Leo, who
was on the same car:</p>

<p>"I remember riding like this once before."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leo, "I suppose so. It was when
you were brought here from the big city where
the ship landed. The same thing happened to
me. But I am used to riding on railroads now.
I don't mind it any more. I like it."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll like it, too," said Nero.</p>

<p>For the rest of that day and all the night the
circus train traveled onward, and it was nearly
morning when it stopped. Peeping out between
the cracks of the wooden cover of his cage, Nero
could see the sun just coming up. It reminded
him of the sunrise in the jungle, and he began
to feel lonesome and homesick again, even
though he had new friends&mdash;Tum Tum, Dido
and Leo.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of noise when the circus
train stopped. Men shouted, horses kicked
about in their wooden cars, the elephants trumpeted,
the tigers growled, the lions roared, while
the monkeys chattered.</p>

<p>Nero felt his cage being run down off the car,
and then he heard Tum Tum talking in elephant
animal language.</p>

<p>"How are you, Nero? All right?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
Tum Tum, as he pushed the lion's cage about so
the horses could be hitched to it again. "Are
you ready to do your tricks in the circus?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Nero. "When do we
begin?"</p>

<p>"Pretty soon," answered Leo from his cage.
"We'll go to the circus lot, then will come the
parade, and then we'll be put in the big tent for
the boys and girls to look at. Then the bands
will play and the performance will start."</p>

<p>"My! that's a lot of things to happen," said
Nero.</p>

<p>Pretty soon one side of his cage was opened,
and Nero's trainer passed by.</p>

<p>"Hello, Nero, old boy!" called the man.
"Did you stand the ride all right? Yes, I guess
you did. Well, we'll soon be doing our tricks
together in the tent," and he patted the paw
Nero held out to him, for this was his way of
shaking hands.</p>

<p>Soon after this Nero felt his cage being hauled
along by a team of eight horses. The wooden
outside covers of the cage were still down, and
Nero could look out through the bars, and
the people could look in. Then Nero saw that
many of the other cages of wild animals were
in line with his, some in front and some behind.
There were many horses, elephants and camels
in line also, and a band was playing music.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>"What's all this about?" asked Nero of Tum
Tum.</p>

<p>"We are going in the circus parade, through
the streets of the town," answered the jolly elephant.
"We always have a parade before the
show. You'll like it."</p>

<p>And Nero liked, very much indeed, his first
parade. <a name="keeper" id="keeper"></a>His keeper rode in the cage with him,
sitting on a chair, and now and then patting the
big head of the lion. Nero liked that, for he
and his keeper were friends. Through great
crowds of people on the streets went the circus
parade, and then the procession went back to
the circus lot where the big, white tents, with
their gaily colored flags, had been set up.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon the show will begin, Nero," said
the keeper, as he got out of the lion's cage.
"The parade was only the first part. The people
will shortly be in here to look at you and the
other animals, and, later on, you and I will do
some tricks."</p>

<p>All at once, as the trainer walked away, Nero
looked out of his cage and saw a big shaggy
animal running along on the ground.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dido!" growled Nero, for at first he
thought it was the dancing bear he saw. But
as the running animal turned, Nero saw that
it was not Dido. This animal was not so large
as the dancing bear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>"I'm not Dido," said the new chap. "And
I don't seem to know you, though I know that
bear in the cage back of you."</p>

<p>"Why, that's who I thought you were," said
Nero. "And so you know Dido?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know him, and Dido knows me,"
said the new animal.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better go back into your cage
before the circus men see you," said Nero.
"How did you get loose? Tell me? I'd like
to get out myself."</p>

<p>"Ho! Ho! You're making a mistake!" was
the laughing answer. "I am not a circus animal.
I'm Don, and I'm a runaway dog. At least I
ran away once, but I ran back again. I came
down to see Dido, whom I met when I was
running away," and Don, the nice, big dog,
wagged his tail at Dido, the dancing bear.</p>

<h3>NERO SCARES A BOY</h3>

<p>Nero, the circus lion, who was much
larger now than when he had been
caught in a jungle trap, was very much
surprised at what Don, the runaway dog told
him. At first the lion boy could hardly believe
that Don was not one of the circus animals.</p>

<p>But as the lion, looking out through the bars
of his cage, saw Don running about and none
of the red-coated circus men trying to catch him,
he said:</p>

<p>"Well, well! it must be true. He isn't a circus
animal at all." And then to Don the lion
said:</p>

<p>"How do you happen to know Dido, the dancing
bear?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a long story," answered Don.
"You can read all about me, and how I ran away,
if you want to, for it's all in a book a man wrote
about me."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Nero. "But I can't
read, and I don't know what a book is, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't read, either," said Don. "But
I know a book when I see one. The little boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
in the house where I live goes to school, and
he has books. Sometimes I carry them home
for him in my mouth. So I know a book when
I see one.</p>

<p>"But as long as you can't read about me I'll
just tell you that in the book the man wrote
about how I ran away, got locked in a freight
car, how I went to a strange city and traveled
about the country. It was then I met Dido, the
dancing bear."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right," growled Dido, licking his
paws, for some one had thrown him a sugared
popcorn ball, and some of the sweet, sticky stuff
was still on the bear's paws. Dido wanted to
get all of it off. "It was then you met me,
Don," went on the dancing bear. "We certainly
had some fine times together!"</p>

<p>"Indeed we did!" replied the runaway dog,
though I should not call him that any more,
as he had run back again, as you all know, and
was now living in a nice home. "And when I
was down at the butcher shop this morning and
saw the circus wagons come from the railroad
yard," went on Don, "I thought maybe I'd see
you again, Dido. So I came here as soon as I
could."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did," said the bear. "This
lion chap is named Nero. He hasn't been out
of the jungle very long."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>"I'm glad to meet you, Nero," barked Don.
"I always like circus animals."</p>

<p>"I am glad you do," growled Nero, in his
most jolly voice. "I think I shall like you,
too, Don, though I don't know much about dogs.
I never saw any in the jungle."</p>

<p>And this was true, for though there are some
dogs in Africa, they are mostly in cities or the
towns where the native black men live. There
may be some wild dogs in the jungle, but Nero
never saw any, and the nearest he ever came to
noticing animals like a dog were the black-backed
jackals. These are animals, almost like
a dog, and, in fact, are something like the Azara
dogs of South America, and now Nero asked
Don if he was a jackal.</p>

<p>But the runaway dog soon told the circus lion
a different story, and then they were friends.
Don and Dido had a nice visit together in the
circus tent before the show began. Don had
simply slipped under the side of the tent to get
in. If any of the circus men saw him they did
not mind, for dogs often come around where
circus shows are given. Perhaps they like to
see the elephants and other strange animals, as
much as the boys and girls do.</p>

<p>After awhile great crowds of people began
coming into the circus tent. The band played
music in another tent, next door, and it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
there that the men and women performers would
do their tricks&mdash;riding on the backs of galloping
horses, leaping about on trapezes, jumping
over the backs of elephants and so on.</p>

<p>Nero paced back and forth in his cage, wondering
what was going to happen, for this was
his first day of real life in the circus. All the
other days had been just getting ready for the
summer shows.</p>

<p>He had liked the parade through the city
streets, when the elephants, horses, and camels
wore such bright and gaily colored blankets.
Now something else was going to happen.</p>

<p>The animal tent, in which stood Nero's cage
and that of the other jungle folk, was soon filled
with boys and girls and their fathers and mothers,
all of whom had come to the circus. They
moved from cage to cage, stopping to toss popcorn
balls to Dido, the dancing bear, and feed
peanuts to Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, and
to the friends of Mappo and some of the other
merry monkeys.</p>

<p>Coming to the cage of the big lion, the boys
and girls would stop and look in, and perhaps
some one would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't he big and fierce! I wouldn't
want to go into his cage!"</p>

<p>And perhaps some one else would answer:</p>

<p>"Pooh! I guess he's a trained lion! Maybe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
he does tricks! When I grow up I'm going to
be a lion tamer."</p>

<p>Of course Nero did not understand any of
this talk, but he liked to look at the boys and girls,
and he was not nearly as wild as he had been
when he lived in the jungle. Nero was really
quite tame, and he liked his trainer very much,
for the man was kind to Nero.</p>

<p>Pretty soon all the people&mdash;even the boys and
girls&mdash;went out of the animal tent, leaving the
animals almost alone.</p>

<p>"Where have they gone?" asked Nero of Dido.</p>

<p>"Oh, into the other tent, where the music is
playing and where the performance is going on.
You'll soon be going in there too, and so shall I."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Nero.</p>

<p>"To do your tricks," answered the bear.
"That is why you were taught to do them, just
as I was taught to dance&mdash;so we can make fun
and jolly times for the boys and girls. Wait,
and you'll see."</p>

<p>And, surely enough, a little later Nero's cage
was moved into the larger tent, next to the one
where the animals were kept. And then Nero's
trainer came and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Well, Nero," said the man, "now we're going
to see if you can do your tricks before a whole
crowd, as nicely as you did them in the barn
at Bridgeport. Don't grow excited. You know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
I'm a friend of yours. Now do your best, and
the boys and girls will laugh and clap their
hands."</p>

<p>So the keeper opened the door of the lion's
cage and went inside. As soon as he did several
of the boys and girls, and the big folks too,
gasped, and some said:</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that terrible! I wouldn't go into
the cage of a real, live lion for anything!"</p>

<p>You see they didn't know Nero was quite
tame, and that the jungle beast liked the man
who fed him and was kind to him.</p>

<p>"Now do your tricks, Nero!" said the trainer.</p>

<p>And Nero did. He jumped over a stick; he
stood up on his hind legs and, putting his paws
on the trainer's shoulders, made believe to kiss
the man, though of course he only touched the
man's cheek with his cold, damp nose, just as,
sometimes, your dog puts his nose against your
cheek to show how much he likes you; next
Nero stood up on a sort of upside-down washtub,
or pedestal; and after that <a name="hoop" id="hoop"></a>he jumped
through a hoop covered with paper.</p>

<p>"And now, ladies and gentlemen," said the
trainer, speaking to the circus crowd, "I will
do the best trick of all. I will have Nero, my
pet lion, open his mouth as wide as he can, and
I will put my head inside!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>And then, all of a sudden, some little boy in
the crowd piped up and cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mister, don't do that! He might bite
your head off!"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at that, even Nero's
trainer, who said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid. Nero is a good lion
and wouldn't bite me. Come on now, old fellow,
for the last and best trick of all!" cried
the man, and he cracked his whip, though of
course he did not strike Nero with it.</p>

<p>The circus lion knew just what to do, for he
had been trained in this trick. I didn't say
anything about it before, because I was saving
it as a surprise for you.</p>

<p>"Open your mouth!" suddenly cried the
trainer, and Nero opened his jaws as wide as
he could.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ah! Look!" cried the people, as they
saw his big, red tongue and the white, sharp
teeth.</p>

<p>"Now!" cried the trainer, and into the lion's
mouth he popped his head.</p>

<p>Everybody in the big circus tent was quiet
for a moment, and then all the crowd cried out,
and clapped their hands and stamped their shoes
on the wooden steps beneath their feet.</p>

<p>"There, you see how tame my lion is!" cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
the man, as he pulled his head from Nero's
mouth, and bowed to the people, who were still
clapping and whistling.</p>

<p>"You are a good lion!" said the trainer to Nero
in a low voice. "Now you shall have a nice
piece of meat, a sweet bone to gnaw, and a good
drink of water. You did your first tricks very
well indeed."</p>

<p>Nero did not quite know what it was all about,
but he felt that he had done well. It did not
hurt him to open his mouth and let the man
put in his head, but it tickled the lion's tongue
a little, so that Nero wanted to sneeze. And
that wouldn't have been a good thing for the
trainer. However Nero didn't do it.</p>

<p>"What makes the people make so much noise?"
asked Nero of Dido, the dancing bear, who came
into the larger tent just then.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's because they liked your tricks,"
was the answer. "They always clap and stamp
their feet when anything pleases them. They
do that when I dance on the platform on Tum
Tum's back."</p>

<p>And, surely enough, the circus crowds did.
They liked the tricks of Dido, the dancing bear,
as much as they had those of Nero.</p>

<p>After a while Nero's cage was wheeled back
into the tent where the wagons of the other
animals were kept, and Nero was given some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>thing
good to eat, and fresh water to drink.
Then he felt happy and fell asleep.</p>

<p>So Nero began his circus life, and he kept it
up all that summer. He traveled about from
place to place, and soon became used to doing
his tricks, having the man put his head into
his mouth and seeing the crowds show their
surprise.</p>

<p>One day, when the show was being given in
a large city, there was a big crowd in the animal
tent. Near Nero's cage were some boys, and
I am sorry to say they were not all kind boys,
though perhaps they didn't know any better.
One of the boys had a rotten apple in his hand
and he said to another lad:</p>

<p>"I'm going to give this rotten apple to one
of the elephants and see what a funny face he
makes when he chews it!"</p>

<p>"That'll be lots of fun," said the second boy.</p>

<p>I don't, myself, call that fun. It isn't fair
to fool animals when you know so much more
than they do. However we'll see what happened.</p>

<p>Nero saw the boys standing near his cage,
and he heard them talking, though he did not,
of course, know what they were saying. But
he could smell the rotten apple. Often, in the
jungle, he had smelled bad fruit, and he knew
that the monkeys would not eat it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>"If bad fruit isn't good for monkeys it isn't
good for elephants," thought Nero, as he saw the
boy hold out the rotten apple toward Tum Tum,
the jolly elephant.</p>

<p>Tum Tum reached out his trunk to take what
he thought was something good, but Nero
roared, in animal language, of course:</p>

<p>"Don't take that apple, Tum Tum! It's
bad!" And then Nero sprang against the bars
of his cage, and, reaching out a paw, with its
long, sharp claws, made a grab for the boy's
arm as he held out the rotten apple.</p>

<p>"Look out! The lion's going to bite you!"
cried a man to the boy, and the boy was so frightened
that he gave a howl and dropped the rotten
apple and ran through the crowd, knocking
to the right and left every one in his way.</p>

<p>Nero roared again and dashed against the
bars of his cage, and while women and children
screamed and men shouted, Nero's keeper and
some of the other animal men ran up to see what
the matter was. There was great excitement in
the circus tent.</p>

<h3>NERO RUNS AWAY</h3>

<p>Once more Nero roared as he looked
over the heads of the crowd to see what
had become of the boy who had tried
to give Tum Tum the rotten apple.</p>

<p>"Hold on there, my lion boy! What's the
matter? Don't do that!" called Nero's trainer
to him in a kind voice. "What happened, anyhow?
Why are you roaring so, and trying to get
out of your cage? Don't you like it here in the
circus?"</p>

<p>Nero stopped roaring at once, and no longer
dashed against the bars of his cage. Perhaps
he thought that, as long as his kind trainer was
at hand, everything would be all right.</p>

<p>"Did some one try to hurt my lion friend?"
asked the trainer, looking at the crowd near the
cage.</p>

<p>"No," some one answered. "But the lion, all
at once, tried to reach out and claw a boy who
was going to give an apple to an elephant. I
saw that. I don't know what made the lion
act so."</p>

<p>"There must have been some good reason,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
said the trainer. "Nero is a good lion. He
wouldn't want to claw a boy just for fun."</p>

<p>And then one of the other boys, who was in
the crowd that had been around the lad who
had the rotten apple, spoke up and said:</p>

<p>"Mister, Jimmie was going to play a trick
on the elephant. He was going to give him a
bad apple just to see what a funny face the
elephant would make."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! Now I understand!" said the
trainer. "My lion must have smelled the rotten
apple and didn't like it. He tried to scare away
the boy, I guess."</p>

<p>"Well, the boy was scared all right," said a
man. "He ran away as fast as he could go."</p>

<p>"He ought to!" said the trainer very sharply.</p>

<p>The excitement, caused by the loud roaring
of Nero, was over now, though, for a time, many
persons had been frightened, for Nero had sent
his powerful voice rumbling through the circus
tent as his father, and the other big lions, had
used to make the ground tremble when they
roared in the jungle.</p>

<p>Then, as things grew quiet and the people
passed along the row of cages, looking at the
animals, Tum Tum, who heard what had happened,
turned to Nero and said:</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to you, my dear lion friend,
for scaring the boy who wanted to give me the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
rotten apple. Most likely, as soon as I'd have
taken it in my trunk, I'd have smelled that it was
bad, and I would not have eaten it. But some
one might have given me a popcorn ball in my
trunk at the same time, and that might have
smelled so good that I wouldn't have noticed
the rotten apple until too late. So you saved me
from having a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm
much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," replied Nero. "I'm
glad I could do you a favor. You have been
kind to me, pushing my cage around, and I
want to be kind to you."</p>

<p>So the two circus animals were better friends
than ever, and that day in the performers' tent
Nero opened his mouth very wide indeed when
his trainer wanted to put in his head.</p>

<p>For many weeks Nero traveled about the
country with the circus, living in his iron-barred
cage, from which he was never taken. Nero
might be a tame lion, but the circus folk did not
think it would be safe to let him out, as Dido,
the dancing bear, was allowed to come out of
his cage.</p>

<p>However, later on, something happened&mdash;</p>

<p>But there, I must tell about it in the right
place.</p>

<p>So, as I said, Nero went about from town to
town with the circus, living in his cage, eating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
and doing his tricks whenever his trainer called
on him to do so. And the people who came to
the circus performances seemed to like, very
much, seeing Nero do his tricks. And they
always clapped loudest and longest when <a name="mouth" id="mouth"></a>the
trainer put his head in the lion's mouth. And
Nero never bit the trainer once, nor so much as
scratched him, even with the tip of one sharp
tooth.</p>

<p>One afternoon of a long hot day, when big
crowds had come to the circus, and after Nero
had done his tricks, and Dido, the dancing bear,
had done his, and Chunky, the happy hippo,
had opened his big mouth so his keeper could
toss loaves of bread into it&mdash;one afternoon Tum
Tum, the jolly elephant, swaying as he chewed
his hay, spoke through his trunk and said:</p>

<p>"Something is going to happen!"</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked Nero,
from his cage.</p>

<p>"Well, I sort of feel it," answered Tum Tum.
"I think we are going to have a big thunderstorm,
such as we used to have in the
jungle!"</p>

<p>"I hope we do!" growled a striped tiger in a
cage next to Nero. "I like a good thunder
storm, where the rain comes down and cools
you off! I like to feel the squidgie mud of the
jungle, too, and when it thunders I growl as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
loudly as I can. I like a storm. I want to get
wet!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>"I like a thunder storm, too," said Tum Tum.
"But you animals in your cages&mdash;you lions
and tigers&mdash;aren't very likely to feel any rain.
We elephants will get wet, and so will the camels
and the horses, for we walk out in the open.
But, Nero, I guess you in your cage won't feel
the storm any."</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe we shall," agreed the lion.
"But I wish we could. I am so hot and dry,
sitting in this cage, that I wish I could get out
and splash around in the mud and water. So
the sooner the thunder storm comes the better."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely to do you much good," went on
Tum Tum, "but it will be cooler, afterward,
anyhow."</p>

<p>And it certainly was very hot in the circus
tent that day. It did not get much cooler after
dark, and when the circus was over, and the big
tents taken down, it was still hot.</p>

<p>"We are not going to travel on the train to go
to the next town where the circus is to show,"
said Tum Tum to Nero, as the men began hitching
horses to the animal cages and the big tent
wagons. "We are to go along the road, in the
open."</p>

<p>"Then maybe I can see the lightning!" exclaimed
Nero. "And, if it rains, I can stick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
my paws out through the bars and get them wet."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Tum Tum. Then he had to go
off to help push some of the heavy wagons, and
it was some time before Nero saw his big elephant
friend again.</p>

<p>Soon the circus caravan was traveling along
the road in the darkness. And yet it was not
dark all the time, for, every now and then, there
came a flash of lightning. The thunder rumbled,
too, like the distant roaring of a band of
lions.</p>

<p>"The storm will soon be here," said the striped
tiger, as he crouched down in one corner of his
cage, which, like that of Nero, was being hauled
along the road by eight horses.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll feel better when it rains," said
the lion.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, the wind began to blow,
there came a brighter flash of lightning, a loud
clap of thunder, and the storm broke. Down
came the rain, in "buckets full," as is sometimes
said, and the horses, camels and elephants loved
to feel the warm water splashing down on their
backs, cooling them off and washing away the
dust and dirt.</p>

<p>Some of the rain even dashed into the cages
of Nero and the tiger, and the jungle cats liked
the feel of it as much as did the other circus
beasts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>But the rain did something else, too. It made
the roads very soft and slippery with mud, and
in the middle of the night, when Nero's cage
was being pulled up a steep hill, something broke
on the wagon. It got away from the horses
and began to roll down the hill backward.</p>

<p>"Look out! Look out!" cried the driver, as
he tried to put on the brake. "The lion's cage
is running away downhill! Look out, everybody!
Look out behind there, Bill on the tiger's
cage! Look out!"</p>

<p>But the lion's cage did not crash into the tiger's
cage, which was the next wagon behind. Instead,
Nero's house on wheels rolled to one side
of the road and toppled over into a ditch.
There was a loud crash as the wooden sides and
top cracked and broke.</p>

<p>All at once Nero saw the door of his broken
cage swing open. He could walk right out, and,
as soon as he got steady on his feet, after being
tossed about by the fall, the lion gave a leap
and found himself standing clear of his cage
in the soft mud, with the rain beating down all
about him.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, I'm loose!" roared Nero.
"I'm out of my cage for the first time since I
was caught in the jungle! Oh, and this is like
the jungle, a little. I can feel the soft mud on
my paws, and the rain on my back!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>Nero opened his mouth to roar, and the rain
dashed in, cooling his tongue. As the lightning
flashed he could see his broken cage at one side
of the ditch, but he was clear of it. When the
thunder roared Nero roared back in answer.</p>

<p>Up above him Nero could hear the circus
men shouting. What they were saying he did
not know, but they were telling one another that
the lion's cage had rolled downhill, had broken,
and that the lion was loose.</p>

<p>Nero looked around him. He could see quite
well in the dark. Off to one side he saw some
tangled bushes and a clump of trees.</p>

<p>"Maybe that is the jungle!" thought Nero.
"I'm going to find out. I'm going to leave the
circus for a while. It was very nice, but I want
to be free. I want to feel the rain and the mud.
Now that I am out of my cage I'll stay loose for
a time!"</p>

<p>And so Nero ran away!</p>

<h3>NERO AND BLACKIE</h3>

<p>The first thing any wild animal does
when it runs away is to find some dark
place and hide. Even though it may be
hungry, an animal, when frightened, will nearly
always hide until it can look about and make up
its mind what to do.</p>

<p>Nero, the circus lion, who got loose from his
cage when it rolled downhill in the storm and
broke open, did this thing. When he had stood
for a moment in the rain and darkness, feeling
the soft mud squdge up between his claws, and
when he had roared a bit, because he felt so
wild and free, Nero sneaked off in the darkness
toward some trees and bushes, which he had seen
in a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>"That may be the jungle," he had said to himself.</p>

<p>But of course you and I know that it wasn't the
jungle. That was far, far away&mdash;across the sea
in Africa.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, listening to the shouts
of the circus men, who were standing about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
broken cage. They could not see Nero in the
darkness, nor even when the lightning flashed,
for the lion crouched down behind some black
bushes.</p>

<p>"Well, Nero got away all right," said one
circus man.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we must get him back!" said the
man who had trained Nero to do his tricks.
"Folks don't like lions wandering about their
farms and gardens. I must find my pet. Here,
Nero! Nero! Come back!" called the trainer.</p>

<p>But though the lion liked the man who had
been so kind to him, Nero was not yet ready
to go back to the circus.</p>

<p>"I have just gotten out of my cage," said Nero
to himself; "and it would be too bad to go back
before I have had some fun. So I'll just run
on and stay in the jungle awhile."</p>

<p>Nero felt very happy. It was a long time
since he had been able to roam about as he
pleased, and though he had no raincoat or umbrella,
and not even rubbers, he didn't mind the
storm at all. Animals like to get wet, sometimes,
if the rain is not too cold. It gives them a bath,
just as you have yours in a tub.</p>

<p>"This certainly is fun!" said Nero to himself,
as he trotted along through the rain and
darkness toward the trees. "I'll find a good
place to hide in and stay there all night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>It did not take Nero long to find a hiding
place. It was a sort of cave down in between
two big rocks in the woods; and it was almost
as good as the cave in which he had lived in
the jungle with his father and mother and Chet
and Boo.</p>

<p>"I wish my brother and sister were here now,"
thought Nero to himself, as he snuggled down
on a bed of dry leaves between the rocks. The
leaves were dry because one rock stretched over
them, like a roof. "And if Switchie were here
he and I could have some fun to-morrow, going
about this new jungle," thought the lion boy.</p>

<p>But Switchie, the lion cub with whom Nero
used to play, was far off in Africa, so our circus
friend had to stay by himself. He curled up
on the leaves, listened to the swish and patter of
the rain, and soon he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Now while Nero was hiding thus in the cave
he had found, the circus men were anxious to
find the lion. They got ropes and lanterns, and
had a new, empty cage made ready, so that, in
case Nero were found, he could be given a new
home. Then, while Nero's trainer and some
men to help him hunt for the lion stayed behind,
the rest of the circus went on to where it was to
give a show the next day. No matter what happens,
the circus must go on, if there is any of it
left to travel. Accidents often happened like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
this one&mdash;cages getting stuck in the mud and
animals sometimes getting away.</p>

<p>But I'm not going to tell you, just now, about
the circus men who stayed behind to hunt Nero.
They did not find the lion very easily. This
story is mostly about Nero, so we shall now see
what happened to him.</p>

<p>All night long Nero slept in the cave. It
lightened and thundered, but he did not mind
that. Nor did he mind the rain, for though he
had been wet, he liked it, and in the cave under
the rock no more water could splash on him.</p>

<p>When Nero awoke the sun was shining
through the leaves and branches of the trees
and down in through the tangle of bushes in
front of the cave where Nero had hidden. The
lion rolled over, stretched out his heavy paws
with their big, curved claws, and opened his
mouth and yawned, just as you have often seen
your dog or cat yawn after a sleep.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nero to himself, "I guess I'll
look around this jungle and see if I can find any
breakfast. I'm hungry, and that nice trainer
man isn't here to give me anything to eat. I'll
have to hunt for it myself, as I used to do when
I was at home. We'll see what kind of jungle
this is."</p>

<p>Nero soon found that it was quite different
from the jungle in Africa. The trees were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
so big, nor were there so many of them, and
the vines and bushes were not so tangled. It
was not quite so hot, either, though this was
the middle of summer, and there were not as
many birds as Nero was used to seeing in his
home jungle. Nor were there any monkeys
swinging by their tails from the trees. It was
quite a different jungle altogether, but Nero
liked it better than his circus cage.</p>

<p>"Now for something to eat!" said Nero, when
he had finished stretching. He stepped from
the little cave out into the bright sunshine, and
looked around. He wanted to make sure there
were no men near by who might catch him and
take him back to that queer house on wheels,
with iron bars all around it. Nero saw nothing
to make him go back into his cave.</p>

<p>Up in the trees the robins and the sparrows
sang and chirped, but if they saw the tawny,
yellow lion moving about, like a big cat, they
paid no attention. They did not seem to mind
Nero at all.</p>

<p>And, pretty soon, Nero found something to
eat in the woods. He had not forgotten how to
hunt, as he had done in the jungle, though it
was rather a long time ago.</p>

<p>Then Nero sniffed and sniffed until he found
a spring of water, at which he took a good drink.</p>

<p>"Well, now that I have had something to eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
and something to drink I feel much better,"
said Nero to himself. "I must have some fun."</p>

<p>So he looked about, wondering what he would
do. It was a sort of vacation for him, you see,
as he did not have to do any of his circus tricks.</p>

<p>"Let's see, now," thought Nero. "I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the lion heard a
rustling noise over in the bushes at one side.
He gave a jump, just as your cat does when
something startles her. Nero wanted to be on
the watch for any one who might be trying to
catch him or trap him.</p>

<p>Then Nero saw a small black animal walk
slowly out from under a big bush. The animal
was something like a little tiger, except that
she was plain black instead of being striped yellow
and black. At first Nero was much surprised.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" called the lion, in animal talk,
which is the same all over the world. "Hello
there! Who are you and where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm Blackie, a cat," was the answer.
"Once I was a lost cat, but I'm not that way
any longer. Who are you, if I may ask?"</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>NERO AND THE TRAMP</h3>

<p>Nero, the circus lion, gave himself a big
shake. His mane, or big fringe of hair
around his neck, stood out like the fur
on your cat's back when a dog chases her, and
then Nero roared. Oh, such a loud roar as
he gave! The ground shook.</p>

<p>"There! Now do you know who I am?"
asked Nero.</p>

<p>Blackie, the cat who was once lost, seemed
quite surprised at the way Nero acted. She
looked at the lion and said:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I don't know why in the world
you are making so much noise. I just asked
what your name was, and there you go acting
as though you were a part of a thunderstorm.
What's it all about, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I was just telling you my name," said Nero,
a little ashamed of himself for having made such
a racket. "I'm a circus lion. At least I used
to be in a circus, but I ran away last night, when
my cage rolled downhill and broke."</p>

<p>"Oh, a circus lion!" mewed Blackie. "Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
I know some folks in a circus. There was Dido,
a dancing bear, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, I know him too!" roared Nero, in delight.
"He's in the same circus I came from!"</p>

<p>"You don't tell me!" exclaimed Blackie.
"And then I knew Tum Tum, a jolly elephant,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, say now, isn't that queer?" laughed
Nero&mdash;at least he laughed as much as a lion
ever laughs. "Why, Tum Tum is in my circus,
too! We are great friends. And once a dog
named Don came to the show, but he did not
stay very long."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know Don, too," said Blackie. "Once
he ran away, and once he chased me. But that
was before we were friends. Say, Nero, I feel
as if I had known you a long time, since we
know so many of the same friends. Tell me,
have you ever been in a book?"</p>

<p>"There it goes again!" cried Nero. "Book!
Book! Book! Tum Tum is in one, and so is
Don, and Dido. I suppose, next, you'll be telling
me that you have had a book written about
you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blackie, rather slowly, as she
waved her tail to and fro, "a man wrote a book
about me. It tells how I got lost, how I was in
a basket, and how I came home to find the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
all away. And maybe I wasn't glad when they
came back! But were you ever in a book?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the circus lion, "and I never
expect to be."</p>

<p>But that only goes to show that Nero didn't
know anything about it. For he is in a book,
isn't he?</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" asked Nero of Blackie.
"Is it in a circus?"</p>

<p>"Gracious sakes alive, no!" exclaimed Blackie.
"I wouldn't know what to do in a circus. I
live in that house over there with a little boy
and girl who are very kind to me. Wouldn't
you like to come over and see them?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. Not just now," Nero answered.
"I'm not much used to being around
houses, though I like boys and girls, for I see
many of them in the circus, and they like to
watch me do my tricks. But I have just run
away, and I want to go about by myself a bit
more. The men from the circus may try to
catch me, you know."</p>

<p>"Don't you want them to?" asked Blackie.</p>

<p>"Well, not right away," answered the lion.
"I want to have some fun by myself first."</p>

<p>"Well, I must be going," said Blackie after a
bit, when she had talked a little further with
Nero. "If ever you're around my house, stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
in and see me. It's right over there, across the
hill," and she pointed to it with her paw.</p>

<p>"I will, thank you," said Nero, switching his
tail from side to side. Then Blackie said goodbye
to him, and the cat walked on through the
woods, back toward the house where she lived.</p>

<p>For two or three days Nero wandered about
in the woods, and, all this while, the circus men
were hunting everywhere for him. But they
could not find him, for the lion kept well hidden
in the woods. And of course, though Blackie
knew he was there, she could not speak man-talk
to tell about him. So Nero remained free and
had a good time.</p>

<p>But one day the circus lion felt lonesome.
He had met none of his friends in the woods,
and had not seen Blackie again, though he had
looked for her. Nero did meet a little animal
who seemed quite friendly. This was Slicko,
the jumping squirrel, and Slicko had a nice talk
with the lion.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do," said Nero to himself
one day. "I'll go over to that house where
Blackie lives and see her."</p>

<p>So Nero started over the hill to go to the house
that Blackie had pointed out as the one in which
she lived. And a very strange thing happened
to the circus lion there.</p>

<p>As it happened, when Nero slunk out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
woods, which were near Blackie's house, no one
saw him. In fact none of the family was at
home, having gone visiting for the day. Blackie
wasn't at home, either, having gone down in the
cow pasture to hunt grasshoppers, so there was
no one in the house. But Nero did not know
that. He went sniffing and snuffing around,
thinking perhaps he could find something to eat,
but nothing had been left out for lions, as Blackie's
folks did not know one was roaming about
so near them.</p>

<p>Nero walked softly up to the kitchen door of
the house. The door was partly open, and this
was strange, if the lion had only known it, for
folks don't usually go away and leave doors open
behind them. And from the open door came
the smell of something good. It was the smell
of meat, and, in fact, was a boiled ham, which
Blackie's mistress had left in a pot on the stove.</p>

<p>Now the reason the door of the farmhouse
was open was because it had been broken open
by a tramp! This tramp, coming to the house
to ask for something to eat and seeing that no
one was at home, had broken open the door. He
was going to get something to eat, and then take
whatever else he wanted. And that's why the
door was open when Nero walked up to it. The
tramp was in the kitchen, cutting himself some
pieces from the cold, boiled ham.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>"My, that smells good!" thought Nero, as he
sniffed the meat. "I guess I'll go in and see if
I can't get some."</p>

<p>So Nero, not, of course, knowing anything
about the tramp, but wanting only to get some
meat and, perhaps, see his friend Blackie, pushed
the kitchen door open with his nose and walked
in.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, that bad, ragged
tramp, who had come in to steal, looked up
from the table where he was sitting, eating ham,
and saw the lion.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! Oh, my goodness me!" cried the
tramp, and he was so surprised and frightened
that he just slumped down in his chair and didn't
dare move. The piece of meat he had been eating
dropped from his hand to the floor, and
Nero picked it up and ate it, licking his jaws
for more.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is terrible!" gasped the tramp. "I
didn't know this farmer kept a trained lion as
a watchdog. I knew he had a black cat, but
not a lion. Oh, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>Of course Nero didn't in the least know what
the man was talking about. But the lion smelled
the meat and he wanted some more; so he sat
down in front of the kitchen door and looked
at the ragged man.</p>

<p>"I don't know who you are," said Nero to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
himself, "and you are certainly not as nice as
my circus trainer.</p>

<p>"But you have some more meat there," Nero
thought on, for he could still smell the ham
on the table. "I think you might give me
a bit more. That little piece was hardly
enough."</p>

<p>And so Nero sat there looking at the tramp,
who was too frightened to move. He couldn't
get out of the door, because the lion was in the
way, and he didn't dare turn his back, to go
over to open a window and jump out, for fear
the lion would spring on him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm in a terrible fix!" thought the tramp.
"This is the first time I was ever caught by a
lion! It's worse than half a dozen dogs! Oh,
what shall I do?"</p>

<p>There really did not seem to be anything for
him to do except just sit there. And Nero sat
looking at him, waiting to be fed some more
meat, as he had been used to being fed in the
circus.</p>

<p>And then something else happened. Back to
the house came the farmer and his wife, and their
little girl was with them. They had returned
from their visit.</p>

<p>"Why, look, Mother!" cried the little girl, as
she went up on the back porch. "The kitchen
door is open!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>"It is?" cried her mother. "I'm sure we
locked it when we went away."</p>

<p>"We did," said the farmer, who was the little
girl's father. "Some one must have gone in&mdash;a
tramp, maybe. I'll see about this!"</p>

<p>The farmer walked quickly to the kitchen door
and opened it wide. It had swung partly shut
after Nero had gone in. And when the farmer
saw the frightened tramp sitting in the chair
at the table, too scared to move, and the lion
between him and the door, on guard, it seemed,
the farmer was so surprised and frightened himself
that he cried:</p>

<p>"Oh my! There's a lion in our kitchen, and
a tramp! Oh, I must get my gun! I must send
for the constable!"</p>

<p>"The constable won't be any good for a lion,"
said the farmer's wife.</p>

<p>"No, but my gun can shoot the lion," said the
farmer. "I'll go for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see the lion!" begged the little
girl. "I saw one in the circus the other day,
and he was tame. Maybe this is the same one.
The circus lion I saw wouldn't bite any one, even
when the man put his head in the big mouth.
Let me look!"</p>

<p>She pushed past her father and mother, and
looked in the kitchen. The little girl saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
frightened tramp, who had been caught by the
lion, and the little girl also saw Nero. And then
she laughed and shouted:</p>

<p>"Why, that's the very same nice, tame lion I
saw in the circus! I'm sure it's the very same
one, for it looks just like him. But I can soon
tell."</p>

<p>"Gracious goodness, child!" cried her mother.
"Don't dare go near him! Besides, it may not
be a tame, circus lion."</p>

<p>"Well, if he is he can do tricks," said the little
girl. "The lion I saw in the circus sat up on a
stool when the trainer told him to. We haven't
any stool big enough, but maybe I can make
the lion sit on his hind legs on the table. That
will hold him."</p>

<p>And then the little girl, doing just as she had
seen the trainer do in the circus, held up her
hand, pointed at the lion in the kitchen, and then
at the table, and cried:</p>

<p>"Up, Nero! Up! Sit on the table!"</p>

<p>And though Nero did not know the little girl,
and did not remember having seen her before,
the trained lion knew what the words meant.
He had heard his trainer say them many, many
times. So Nero slowly walked over to the table,
got up on it with a jump, and then and there,
right in front of the tramp and the little girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
and her father and mother, <a name="hind" id="hind"></a>Nero sat on his hind
legs on the table, just as he was accustomed to
sit on a stool in the circus ring.</p>

<p>"There! What did I tell you?" cried the
little girl, clapping her hands. "I knew he was
the tame, circus lion! Doesn't he sit up nice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the farmer, "he does. But there
is no telling how long he may sit there. He
must have escaped from the circus, and I had
better telephone the men that he is here.
They'll be glad to get him back."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing he scared the tramp," said
the farmer's wife, as she looked at the ragged
man. "What are you doing here, anyhow?"
she asked him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I just came in to get something to eat,"
he whined. "And then your lion wouldn't let
me go."</p>

<p>"He isn't my lion," replied the farmer. "But
he's done me a good turn. I'll have the constable
come here and take you away."</p>

<p>And a little later the constable, who had been
telephoned for, came and took the tramp to jail.
Nero looked on, wondering what it was all about,
and wishing some one would give him something
to eat. And the little girl thought of this.</p>

<p>"The tramp has spoiled the ham for us,
Mother," she said. "Can't I give the rest of it
to Nero?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>"Oh, yes, I suppose so," said the farmer's wife.</p>

<p>So Nero got something to eat after all. And
then, when he had fallen asleep in the woodshed
where the farmer locked him, the circus men
came to take the tame lion back with them.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to get Nero again," said his
trainer. "I guess he has had enough of running
away."</p>

<p>And as they were bringing up the new cage
which was to take the lion back to the circus,
in came Blackie from the meadow where she had
been catching grasshoppers.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you did come to see me, after all!"
she mewed to Nero.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the lion, in animal talk, which
none of the people could understand, "I came to
see you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was away," said Blackie.</p>

<p>"So am I. But I really had a pretty good
time," said Nero. "And I scared a man who
wore very ragged clothes, something like the
funny clowns in our circus. And now I am
going back there. I'm glad to have met you,
Blackie."</p>

<p>"And I'm glad I met you, Nero. Maybe
someday I'll come to your circus."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," growled Nero.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" called the little girl to the circus
lion, as he was hauled away in his cage. "Good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>-bye!
I'm glad you did the sitting-up trick for
me!"</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Nero was back in the
circus tent again.</p>

<p>"Well, where in the world have you been?"
asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Oh, off having adventures, as I suppose you'd
call them," answered the lion.</p>

<p>"Adventures!" exclaimed the jolly elephant.
"Well, if that man hears about them he'll put you
in a book."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not," said Nero, as he curled up
in his new cage.</p>

<p>But I did, just the same, and here's the book.
And so we come to the end of Nero's many
adventures&mdash;at least for a time. But there are
other animals to tell about.</p>

<p>In the circus was a striped tiger, of whom I
have spoken. I think I will tell you about him.
And so the next volume in this series will be
called: "Tamba, the Tame Tiger: His Many
Adventures."</p>

<p>And now we will leave Nero peacefully sleeping
in his cage, and dreaming, perhaps, of the
little girl and Blackie and of the tramp with the
boiled ham.</p>

<p>In all nursery literature animals have
played a conspicuous part; and the reason
is obvious for nothing entertains a child
more than the antics of an animal. These
stories abound in amusing incidents such
as children adore and the characters are
so full of life, so appealing to a child's
imagination, that none will be satisfied until
they have met all of their favorites--Squinty,
Slicko, Mappo, Tum Tum, etc.</p>
